       "  'comments': 'i think at that time US had skin color racist , how eugene can be a captain? At first i\\'ve never thought I\\'d love this drama so much. But the moment I\\'ve seen episode 1 , i can already say that this drama is so far the greatest historical kdrama i have watched ever. There has never a kissing scene nor any affectionate touching, yet you can feel so much love between the female and male lead. Hats off to all the cast especially my Mr.Sunshine, Captain Eugene Choi (Byung-hun oppa) ❤ This is a highly recommend drama no once should ever miss. I am crying as i am watching the final moment. We should bid \"See you again\", instead of \"Goodbye\", so see you again Mr.Sunshine ❤❤❤ I didn\\'t know it was Yeon Seok:\"\" I\\'m happy to see you here, chilbong <3 never imagine would fall in love with beautiful sad ending. everything here is so realistic, i think the ending is perfect consider the situation they face, a happily ever after ending wouldn\\'t be match. Cinematography, cast, song, emotion, everything are sooo perfect The best drama of 2018 great cast and a real tear jerker. I loved every moment. Look forward to seeing more kdramas from Lee Byung-Hun Lee and Kim Tae-Ri as well as all the other actors and actresses. It’s masterpiece and excellent portrayal of the entire cast The 3 male leads are so adorable! Mr. Sunshine is the best film/series I have ever seen!! I\\'m 74 and I\\'m so glad I\\'ve lived this long, to see this beautiful series. It was perfectively cast, perfect story, perfect cinematography, every detail in the making, perfect!!! Every cast member played their character to perfection. I cried and laughed. I saw this twice on Netflix and just had to own a copy. Thank you to all for making an old woman happy!!! Any recommendations guys to get me over this amazing drama! Amazing, one of the best korean drama that I have ever seen, the actors were outstanding, and I mean more than one. It was a job well done in every way. Many thanks Anybody know who played as young king in ep 1? Best drama so far! Can\\'t wait for your next project!xx One of best drama.i fall in love with Goo dong mae ( yoo yeon seok) Kim Tae Ri\\'s character kills me!! This drama is epic and beyond my expectation. Definitely the best historical drama i watched so far (had been watching kdrama for 16 years). The drama is very unique and beautiful in many aspects. The writer n director did awesome job. lee byung hun english was great and i love it! I’ll miss the awkward trio bromance and eugene choi go ae shin sad love story the most! I\\'d love watching Saeguk drama. it makes me want to learn more about Korean Culture. This drama telling us, it is not an easy thing to be a King, I feel sorry for the King of Joseon in that era. He feels so much pressure because of the Traitor inside the Palace and also Japan.Thanks to the Righteous Army. They were fighting all their life for their Joseon. I was cry, can not move on from this drama. A Gun, Glory and Sad Ending. Today im already finished watching Mr. Sunshine. Seriously ill never watching genre history since Moonlight and Scarlet Ryeo. I admit it this drama got #1 in my drama history. Eugene and Ae shin never kiss but that storyline, plot, casts much much better than romance drama in every eps kissing. ALL CASTS Mr. Sunshine so amazinggggg!! Im falling in love with them. Goodjob. I will waiting for drama history can beat this Mr. Sunshine:) I was cry a river on the last episode!!! oh my god why writer-nim have to broke my heart to pieces:\"\"\"\"( Lee Byung Hun is so handsome. There were multiple times I felt like I was falling in love with him. His expressive eyes and voice is his strongest suit. @Azu03 because Wan-ik was tracking her, and having short hair was a shame, so cutting her hair meant Ae-shin wouldn\\'t go outside, since @Azu03 From what I remember, Gu Dong-Mae cut Ae-shin\\'s hair because it was dangerous for her to be seen outside(Wan-ik, Hi-na\\'s father, was trailing Ae-shin). It was a shame back then to have short hair , because the hair is from your parents (Confucianist Filial Piety). Dong-mae said to Ae-shin that her mercy — saving his life when he was a young butcher’s son — kindled a false hope, and that false hope is what sliced her hair. But it was more than that, as he would admit later (to Eugene, after being beaten with the broom). He knew he would get beaten (by her grandfather) or even worse , but he did it for her sake. Can\\'t move on from this drama?❤❤ I love love love this drama. I\\'m almost done, and I\\'m scared to see its end. Such a moving drama, I can\\'t put into words all the feelings it gives me. I love all characters, but my favorite by far has been Goo-Dong-Mae. He has stolen my heart. I sometimes wish he could stay w Ae-Shin and at times have really dislike her for being so cold to him when all he\\'s done is shown her how much he cares for her. I wish I could take her place. There\\'s only one thing that\\'s been bothering me quite a lot besides the sad end which I\\'m already trying to prepare myself for. Why did Goo-Dong-Mae cut Ae-Shin\\'s hair? Does anyone know? If anyone can put to rest my mind by answering I will owe you big. Epic drama. I never commented. But i want to recommend this series. still can not move on after this series end 1 month ago. i\\'ve never write a comment before but this drama really moves my heart to do it. this is literally the BEST kdrama i\\'ve watched in my entire life. from cinematography, interesting plot until the acting, they deserve a 10/10. i cried a lot, it made my heart aches. also, i\\'m not really a fan of historical kind of drama but w o w this is an exception. great job, mr sunshine! This drama has the best cinematography so far, better than Goblin I should say. I rarely watch dramas with Joseon era but this drama is something else. The romance between the leads is so beautiful, they didn\\'t even kiss for once but their romance grips my heart. Such a beautiful storyline with balanced conflicts. It has many characters but somehow I didn\\'t forget even of them. Literally the best drama I\\'ve ever watched. 9 out of 10. You should watch this, worth the episodes, worth the actors and worth your time. I appreciate and thank all of the actors who played this drama, also the writer, I watched this drama because of her and I didn\\'t even regret a tiny bit. (I\\'ve just finished the last episode and I\\'m bawling my eyes out) I rarely commented on any drama, but this one really deserved one, a drama with a nice plot, great cinematography, and poetic lines....great work from all the staffs and actors.....its opened our mind to a new set of expectation towards kdrama Best Drama Ever! From Ae-shin\\'s POV there was only one man; never was there three men. There was NO love triangle because she had NO feelings for any man but Eugene. Best dramaOf the year! Korenan drama\\'s standard will go higher because of this drama. Gun, glory, sad ending. Good bye mr. Sunshine This drama is full sorrow Im\\' crying all the time but I really love it! The cinematography is breathaking and amazing. I watch few episode i was like hmmm and just kept watching weirldy. i getting addict to watch the next episode.. Awesome story. I recommend do watch it. It\\'s heart touching. Fab Three men loves a woman. I was watching \"Portrait of a Beauty\" (2010) which starred the sultry Kim Gyu-Ri and noticed the boat scene at 23mins 30sec is the same river that Eugene and Ae-Shin took boat rides to the potter\\'s place. It\\'s clearly seen in episode 19 when Col. T. Mori point blank shot Hong-Pa in the head. However, the close-ups on the boat were not shot on location. Well I finished the drama yesterday and the story was everything in all kinds of feeling I had. Romance, Happiness, Disappointment, Angry, etc.... I was wondering where is all this beautiful places comes from. The Writer always has a way with words. I liked the romance which made me expect something. Actors were natural with acting and expression. For All their effort They had a better outcome. For all my waiting Hi5. The statement at end of ep 9.... so touching thanks for the beautifull drama. like it very much, from story and the place. but, the romance just little knock my heart, i hope it like a goblin. but from the story is very interesting like chicago typewriter.... ok next dramaa Nope, the ratings is one of the highest rating in cable history. First on average, followed by Goblin. And 2nd on the finale, the first is Reply 1988. Excellent. We loved it. So diferent and intresting. Good caracteres great story! Wow what a drama!!! Great story!!! I have never ever write a review before but today i will write one because this is such a superb drama. Great acting, very good story line, great directing and cinematography!!!! Now I understand why koreans hated japanese at one time. This is amazing!!! If u have not seen this, watch it. You will never be sorry!!! I have watched quite a few KDramas over the years but this one really impressed me. I am quite surprised at the low ratings in Korea. I thought the Lead actor and actress both did a superb job. Truly heart-warming and very touching. I am also very impressed with the cinematography. The best scenes were both Ae-Sin and Eugene on the bridge with the background and the other one was Dong Mae pulling on Ae-Sin\\'s gown at the Calligraphy store. Absolutely superb!!! its just a work of art. I also love the humor. The bromance is endearing. The only thing that bothers me is that the leads need more chemistry in my opinion. Im always looking for how affected Ill be with the romantic scenes. The feeling of excitement in love and romance. In Filipino term its called \"kilig\".I guess i didnt find that here despite how good the actors are which the only downside of the series in my opinion. I only feel a dongseang relationship, or sisterly affection when watching them. But nevertheless, It was amazing. This is epic:) After watching this drama, suddenly all of dramas that I\\'ve watched just feel like trash..?, this drama is gold, still can\\'t move on so I repeat it again and again.. The ratings don\\'t lie. This is exceptional Never cried this much watching a kdrama. This drama is heartbreakingly breathtaking. Anyone who is debating whether to watch this or not, i strongly recommend u watch this. You definitely wont regret it. Best drama series...a very heartwarming drama..super nice.. Now what am I going to watch. Looked so forward every week. Best series of all time. It\\'s the best vi ever seen. We are starving, we are crying for to see these persons at least once at a another time. We don\\'t want to lose them. We love them, let them come again in i now serie. We love them, we want them. I\\'m from Sweden and hadn\\'t ever seen a film made in South Korea. I now have learned, not just but the Marsh-films, that SouthKorean is the land I (and my wife) want to visit. Kim Kang Hoon is such a potential actor, how can he grasped and delivered so well at such a young age? Is it possible to feel so many emotions because of the main couple\\'s acting, but not convinced by the romance??? Agree, that was a beautiful and touching drama but yet not logically and fairly ended, since in the beginning it always said that it was based on real historical events I believe that the audience deserved at least to know what happened in the end of this fight for freedom so that we could feel better for all those WHO died in the name of Korean independence...so many things left unrevealed in the end that I just feel being a bit cheated somehow, just a few words in the end could leave a spectator with a bit better feeling... SPOILER after moonlovers. Finally! There\\'s a kdrama again that made my heart shattered.. after watching the 1st eposode of this, i got hooked. So i was always waiting for Saturdays and sundays to watch this. this war/historical series is really awesome! One of the greatest series i have ever watched! This is the best k drama I ever watched. This drama is one of easier way for delivering national history and increasing curiousity to dig more about what happen at that moment (factual history). For me, who find history lecture is boring, watching this kind of drama is helpful. And it make us appreciate more our heroes. @John — Lee Se-Hoon\\'s (Minister of Foreign Affairs) mistress Gye-hyang, ran off with the gold bars. In my opinion, this was the most poetic, mature and realistic show ever scripted. Throughout all the K-dramas that I\\'ve watched, Mr. Sunshine really had a different feel and approach to me as an audience. Maybe because of the historical events and patriotism that was related to the story. Btw, I wouldn\\'t be surprised if Mr. Sunshine win some awards. This drama deserve to win tho This drama is really good, I know it\\'s a fiction but somehow I wish it was real, so everyone could remember their name who has fallen for their country Everything was great about this series, story line, actors, etc. But I have not read any comments about the cinematography which was simply superb! Freeze any frame of the movie and you\\'ll get a perfect image. Gorgeous colors, faultless composition. It has been a while - if ever - that I saw anything so breathtakingingly beautiful. Who is minister’s lee wan ik’s mistress? The actor who steals the gold bar and tries to buy French dresses? Who is she After reading so much positives about this drama i just give it a try. its so different from the writer\\'s previous works. Iits fantastic, the storyline, acting of the main leads and the suporting ones are excellent. Mr sunshine beats the the writer\\'s two recent dramas dots and goblins which received a lot of buzz, hands down. No cheesy lines or over the top love scenes which is eun sook\\'s trademark. Simply The Best Korean TV Series I Have Watched. I Have watching Korean TV Series and Movies everyday for Ten long years now. I have reviewed some segments of the last episode several times and are still amazed and cherished by this drama. Unlike the hundreds of dramas I\\'ve seen, here the true protagonist is the Hystory created by the characters who lived that sad era. As in Goblin (4 main characters), even here I loved all the five main characters. The cinematography and screenwriter are as brilliant as expected by Lee Eung-Bok and Kim Eun-Sook. The actors are excellent. Each episode is really good, from the first episodes full of hope for a love story, set in a context brighter than the second context, made for most of battles and massacres. From the epic and glorious episodes full of a lot of events, like episode 19, to the last ones with a perfect beautiful sad ending. Usually when i watch saad scens only tears drop frm my eyes but this drama made me cry like a babyy ... gun, glory, sad ending At first, I dont have any interest in this drama. I thought this drama would be a typical cliche drama when I read the title. But when I saw who is the story writer, I decided to watch this one since I love all of her drama story. The most heartbreaking Kdrama I\\'ve ever watched. Great job to the cast and production staff! I allow a lot for artistic license, but I just have to say this. The chances of shooting the pin out of a coupling on a railcar moving at full speed with max tension is so remote, they may as well have had a lightning bolt from heaven knock it out. Just saying. It was a groaner moment. I am the type of person who don\\'t really cry no matter how sad the drama is. The most I cry will two drops of tears but this one literally makes me cry like a baby. And even after I cried, I still can\\'t get over it. Just by seeing the poster make me feel sad. I prepared for all kinds of endings way before the drama end but when it really ended, I couldn\\'t control my emotion. The actors really fit their role. The chemistry is amazing. They don\\'t even kiss once but I can feel the attachment between leads. Just so amazing man. Before I watch this, only Lee Byun Hun is my fav actor. Now I love all the leads. I swear to god if I ever been to Korea, I will go and find Lee Byun Hun before I find those idols. Best drama for 2018 man. If you haven\\'t watched, go and watch now!!!!! THIS IS SPOILER!!! Not that a person reincarnates looking like they did in their previous life; that happens in fantasy dramas. But let\\'s say it does; Ae-Sin might appear as the child of Dae-Young and Myeong-Joo in part 2 of \"Descendants of the Sun\". The actors Jin Goo and Ji Won had played the roles of Ae-Sin\\'s parents. With a hardened heart I managed to finish the drama ( only by skipping the merciless massacre scenes). First, I must say as a foreigner, I was astounded by the A Class acting of the k actors portraying each role( from minor to major). It was as if you are really venturing through 19th century Joseon. Hats off to Kim Eun suk for this eye opening drama and performance. This is the most romantic drama without even any single kiss . But the feeling of each characters can describe how much love they had . Absolutely best drama this year . Cinematography will definitely get an award for this drama, and costume design should as well. You could be entertained solely by Kim Min-Jung\\'s dress-of-the-moment! The depiction of the conflicting pressures on Korea at that time, were well done, and the supporting actors had many great performances. Please, a little less ghastly green hues next time, and ease up on the filters and color enhancements a little. Such a great series????Cinematography, Acting, Story and Soundtrack! Superb??I hope there is more than 24 episodes.. If you didnt watch it yet.. u better start watching it...!! Korean is such a genius to their storylines! SPOILERS By far the best drama I\\'ve watched... Out of DOTS, Goblin, and Mr. Sunshine, Mr. Sunshine definitely wins for me. The actors portrayed their characters very well and the plot was very enticing because it\\'s based on Korea\\'s history. Honestly speaking, I\\'m a Japanese American but I feel so much sadness for the Koreans who fought for their country back then against Japan. I hope Japan would offer an apology to Korea soon... I finished a bix of tissue for the final episode; but it im glad we get to see the trio sitting together for their final drinks like old friends what shall i say... hmm .. no words really how beautiful and unique this drama is. watched around 100 already but nothing ,absolutely nothing compare to this one!! Hope all actors (first ,second ,third leads)get best awards and the drama ,not only in Korea but internationally too! WEstern world should learn how to make movies. not many goood ones as this those days.Epic masterpiece!! 82/100???!!! sorry people.. please give me better Korean drama because i don\\'t believe is there any. SPOILERS! Epic series. Do recommends this show to everyone, and especially people moved to United States from other countries. The Bill of Right what makes United States a unique country in this world. Omg ....I cried so much last episode. When the King cried made me cry too A good tragic stylish historical drama with a top actor ensemble, top director and top writer. But I still felt I was missing the context of it all - why all this effort just to do what seems to be another anti-imperialist anti-Japan story? This story line has already been done in the past - I\\'m sure this drama probably did not go over well in Japan. And also, why now? SPOILER: Damn why it had to end like that? I\\'m broken into pieces???????????? Why?? Why???? Very cruel to our hearts... How can we move on????? From the very beginning of this drama I knew the ending would be tragic, because history tells us what happened to the Koreans then. This drama is a truly masterpiece from Eunsook jagganim. The last episode just made me crayyyy omg (T___T) dunno how i will live my sat&sun without Eugene and Ae Shin. <//3 The best drama ever in 2018!! I\\'m crying and laughing all the time. I will never forget this drama. I\\'m so sad and heart broken:\\'( but anyway well done guys!!!!!! What an amazing and great story. Thank you so much for the team production of mr sunshine and absolutely we need to appreciate kim eun sook has made this story such meaningfull and deep. Moreover the actors especially kim tae ri and lee byung hun, you move my heart guys, you made me cry like a baby, well done guys!!!!! Sad ending:( is this a drama or bucket of onions?? TT The best korean drama so far... I\\'m broken. THE LAST EP IS SO DAAMNNN. I CAN\\'T STOP CRYING!!! Good job for all cast, writer-nim, and staff production. All characters portrayed in each episode are memorable that you will tell yourself ... eh I saw that .... eh I know that .... and that at the end you remember all as though they never left. Last episode jut make me cry a river:( I really love this drama series,it made me cried.if this really happen in real life it’s so sad..so upsetting that most all of them died..but I’m one of your pan...so good luck for the next so long to all the casts,love it!!!hope I can watch more like this really good movies or tv series...????? Superb Drama another scarlet heart:((( sad My tears flowed along as they\\'re leaving:\"( 14 minutes ago Say goodbye to this epic drama. All cast did great so tht the staffs. I dont think i can watch any drama again on very long time after this..... Just watch episode 24. What a sour experience. Hee-Sung, Dong-Mae and Eugene are the three amigos no one will ever forget. Its funny how their friendship blossomed with nothing in common at the beginning but they were the same at the end. Love them so much. I still wanted a little more. Like Nice drama. Great actor/actress. I think some part too bloody. If you are too sensitive of that kind of bloody image think about it, before decide to see it. I didn\\'t spect that end. Surprise ending. War is never pretty and History always hold painful memory. This drama reiterates this and also remind us the unsung heroes who created history. SPOILERS: Just finished watching the finale in USA. I thought I had it all figured out with Eugene and Ae-Sin living happily ever after on the mountain. So disappointment Eugene died, along with everyone else. I was hooked from the very first episode ...So what about the \"Fiction\" part? Could the ending have been at least a fictional happy ending. I watched 24 hours of TV for the hero to die - that\\'s painful. Having said that and finally back to reality, all the actors were awesome!!! Great Job! Timeless! Breath taking cinematography and a love story with heart-felt emotional performances all around by an amazing cast. The soundtrack and script timing is phenomenal and evokes emotions from deep within. I just finished watching episode 24 (twice!). Congratulations to everyone involved in this excellent production! It was fantastic and I am so sorry that it has ended! I look forward to more of your work! loved-seen the 24 today and made me so sad. Hate that you all aren\\'t gonna have season 2. Loved the casts and Eugene. Those two were adorable together. Thank you for amazing series. Will be watching something else with Eugene in it-great actor. I haven’t stopped crying yet. Beautiful, beautiful story! I’ll never forget this one. LBH never failed at his any acting, I love this drama pretty much The best drama ever. Goodbye. See u again I love Mr. Sunshine. The acting were superb and the cast were great. Hope to see this being aired in our country. I really hate the ending. Yang-hwa\\'s (Hina) passing is the saddest for me. I cried. I guess I feel for her because in spite of being abused—her body riddled with scars—she remained unscathed by bitter resentment. And she never reconnected with her mother in this life nor received love from Dong-Mae whom she had feelings for till her confession to him, moments before her last breath. The amount of tears n blood in ep 23 is insane,cant wait the last epsd. I love mr.sunshine , i think great drama all time . Please eugene , go aeshin,dongmae and hee sung don\\'t die . Oh my, just watched episode 23. I can\\'t, its too much!! That was way too much for me. I\\'ve been crying my eyes out! I can\\'t put in words my feelings for this episode. As always, it was a great episode! Fell in love with Korea when I visited there in late 1970s. Found Mr Sunshine by accident, and am very glad that I did. Outstanding cinematography and costuming, and the writers and actors have done such a beautiful job of development of their characters that I have fallen for all of them and am wishing for them all to somehow have happy endings. This is one of those programs that I wish could go on forever. @Sonia Love the story and all the fantastic actors! Not a weak are a weak actor, great actors and actresses. Every person character is so appeling! Does anyone know why they didnt air the finale episodes this weekend? I hope it will have a happy ending i love them both same with dong mae and hee sung and heena Mr. Sunshine is one of the best dramas I\\'ve ever seen. I was totally hooked from the first screen shot. It is lavish, the cinematography breathtaking and the range of emotions throughout the episode rival This Is Us. Lee Byung Hun was the reason I started watching and then his chemistry with all the other actors hooked me for good! Eugene will die sacrificing himself to prove him a noble man after all in the eyes of Joseon. Aeshin will be broken hearted and continue the fight alongside Dong Mae, financed by Hee Sung. I love, love, love this series.! Don\\'t want it to end? When does season 2 start? The acting is amazing! Great drama. I think it\\'s very appealing to the audience, because the characters are well balanced and well represented - both men and women. There is no damsel in distress that needs saving like in most dramas. Here you have both male and female leads that can hold their own - all of them are strong on their own - which is why both guys and girls in the audience can relate, and enjoy this. OMG! Thank you Netflix for the shows you are making available for me to see that were produced all over the world. Mr Sunshine is my favorite so far. I am now a fan of all the actors in this series. I want to thank the screen writer and director for making this so fun to watch.I so prefer the decent love and romance of this show over how movies are made in the US. I am referring this to all my friends, even if we all have to read the subtitles. Of course this movie is all fiction and just touches on some historical events. It only encouraged me then to start studying the history of Korea. Like every country it has had its sad times, bad times and happy times. Thank you for helping me to find love of the Korean people. Remember, every life is important. The best series of 2018 hands down.... It deserves a grand prize /daesang..... Everything is perfect... A masterpiece really I can confidently say this drama is waaaay better than goblin /dots... The female leads are bad as.... Everything is beyond perfect I feel blessed to watch this magnificent masterpiece on TV, it deserves a daesang and best acting ,directing and script awards..... Like Koreans should b really proud of it The beautiful Kim Sa-Rang missed out on a career-defining role in Hee-Na. Nevertheless, her replacement Kim Min-Jung has given us an unforgettable performance. There are some comments about Dongmae cutting Aesin\\'s hair off, so I would like to explain..It was said that in korean history a long hair is like korean traditional symbol or better, it is a part of body given from parents. Korean women wear it with pride, so cutting hair off is like punishment and she will live with shame for a long time and can\\'t get rid of it so easily...Dongmae cut her hair off to make her stay at home until her hair grows back to the same length before it got cut off, because if she leaves house, she will face sad, pity or even disgusting views from people....or also hear rumors although rumors about her have already spread after she broke off the engagement with Heesung... Its amazing kdrama....hopefully not sad ending...but if i can ,i wanna give 99,99% vote best to this drama..actor actrees and another player its so great..chemistry about two player,mr and mrs uegene give me inspiration how to love my fiance...very romantic and hot without kiss(xxx)..finally its a great..from indonesian fans This drama sets the bar pretty high for any other Korean drama to reach. no mr. sunshine this weekend!!!! oh no my days will be so gloomy!!! huhuhuhu...I cant wait for another week!! my waiting for this day is wasted!! I cant wait for episode 29!!!! who will have a sad ending?! oh I hope the 5 of them will live happily ever after!! if it does Mr. Sunshine will be my top one in my all favorite drama list!!! We live in Canada, are Canadians, Caucasian and seniors. We love Mr. Sunshine and we are going to be so sad when it is over. We can\\'t seem to get enough of Lee Byung-Hun and his co-stars. These are beautifully written. We are not used to this kind of drama and romance and we can\\'t get enough of this heart felt show. Please do more Lee Byung-Hun. We are absolutely hooked on the Korean shows and series. More, More and More we ask. Thank you for showing us how romance and drama can be played out instead of having all the sex and gory bloodshed. The way this has been written is truly a work of a genius in this day and age. I normally don\\'t care to watch shows/movies with subtitles (I need English) only because I have eye problems, however I am hooked on this series. I have just one question ... The English Title..... Mr Sunshine? I\\'m I missing something in the Korean to English translation OR is it sarcasm because the main character is anything but sunny. I watch for the few moments when Eugene cracks half a smile. There\\'s no reason why Ae-Shin and Eugene shouldn\\'t live. Their characters are fictional after all. That said, the lyrics to the first OST suggests otherwise. @Drama Heir Episode 22 or perhaps ep 21... I think Song Young said something about Lady Ae-sin\\'s father and mother will meet again in better day of Korea... And guess what? Lady Ae-sin\\'s father and mother are indeed meet again in the future which aired on Descendants of the Sun... What twists of event... No wonder it used Descendent... I was so confused for a moment there Noooooo Mr. SUNSHIME this weekend.. aaaaarrghh!! Spoilers - Spoilers - Spoilers - Spoilers - Spoilers - Spoilers Karen, those were the words in english Ae shin first said to her english teacher I think there is a riddle we must solve Who watch eh last trailer??? This amazing series has universal appeal. I should know, I am an African-American woman and enjoy well-made films and series and Mr. Sunshine is one of the best creations of the 21st century. From the luscious cinematography to the original storyline to the absolutely first class acting, Mr. Sunshine is complete entertainment that gives viewers a sense of an important segment of Korean history and the human lives affected during its timeframe. Well...all the fans out there, want to play? Keep this going please, great job! This is an excellent series. The 5 principal actors are all very good and convincing and, in particular, I am admiring the performances of Kim Tae-Ri and Lee Byung-Hun. It\\'s a touching love story. Fantastic cinematography. A visual poem. Excellent acting, directing, scenery, and costumes. A special? Noooo. Were is my 23th episode. On 22th September we have just a special? No. Just no. Honestly, this drama is addictive, truly addictive. This is the 1st Korean drama I have ever watched because I usually don’t watch shows where you have to read subtitles. But I could tell Mr. Sunshine was worth watching. It’s brilliantly made, & the acting is superb! One minute I’m crying, then smiling then yelling for the rebel army! Although I’m anxious to see the last 2 episodes, I hate to see the story come to an end! Would be great if there was a season 2!! In case there isn’t, I hope Eugene and Go Ae-Shin end up getting married & don’t die fighting w/resistance. Also I hope Kim Hee-Sung, Hee-Na & Goo Dong-Mae survive the Japanese and find some happiness. Ep 22 had us thinking Dong-Mae had died, although I was hoping by some miracle, he survived. The guy has 9 lives! It was so sad but heroic when Seung-Goo sacrificed himself. Even Hee-Na had enough & sacrificed her Glory Hotel to take out a good portion of Japanese army!! Go girl! Wow...after the next 2 episodes, wonder what else I want to watch with such a feverish passion. It has been a \"longing\" looking forward to Sat & Sun for the follow-ups. I will watch again & again; introduction, shakehands, hug, longing.....& \"I love you\" finally last week! What a romance & heart wrenching love. how can i move on from this drama? (T_T) even goblin took me a month!! I don\\'t like this drama. How can this drama be so rude? Mixing my feelings. I feel like dying, crying, angry in one moment. And there\\'s no preview for the next eps in the end of the episodes. how dare are they, not putting the preview? and i hope Dong-mae can realize his fate is kudo hina, like please. their chemistry is wow. Just saw episodes 21 & 22 . I can\\'t deal with it anymore. Its so intriguing and fascinating at the same time. I get a mini heart and panic attack on each episode. Ive cried, laughed and unintentional fallen in love with every character. The scenery is magnificent. The directing is outstanding. The acting is superb. But the writing, oh my, the writing is so much more than excellent. I love the main couple and their tragic love story. However, the writers execute the 2nd leads so well that they feel like main leads. In fact, I believe that there is no second leads and all of them are first leads. Their backgroud their stories is amazing how they\\'re portrayed and its the magnificent story telling that makes is so great and marvelous. Kudos to every single person that is involved in this great drama. Congratulations!! This has been a beautifully crafted story reflecting the loss of innocence of the characters and the country they love so profoundly. I applaud the beautiful woven tapestry of the story and dialog written by Kim Eun-Sook. You have paid homage to the culture, etiquette and discreet understanding between such well developed and intriguing characters. Your characters brought us laughter, heartbreak, hope and fear. To engage an audience so deeply illustrates your incredible talent. Please be happy ending...please be happy ending.... That scene when Ae-shin\\'s uncle told her that her parents years later in this better Joseon, will recognize each other and fall in love again...awww, they found each other and became soldiers as Myung joo and Dae young from Descendants of the Sun!!! Im so happy.. i dont know why, but this drama is really the best!! Writer-nim always be my favorite drama writer!! This has been my favorite drama of all! Awesome cast, thrilling, historical, romantic, dramatic... All main actors were Grrreat! Thank you Lee Byung-Hun,\\tKim Tae-Ri, Yoo Yeon-Seok,Kim Min-Jung and Byun Yo-Han for your very real acting! You brought to life your characters! Thank you producers, Director and all cast for an wonderful drama. Thank you for epic production, beautiful costumes and beautiful settings. Loved every minute! I am sure I will watch it again and again! Watching this drama makes me laughed, cried at excited. Highly recommended, I really like the story. Lee Byung Hun is very handsome. I like the way he speaks english. Hope this will be a happy ending. Thanks for the story Kim Eun Sook, From Secret Garden I always love to watch your drama. Every episode heartbreaking?, i dont wanna end this drama.. Because it\\'s hard to move on. Definitely ill watch it over and over again. I wish this series will not end. I love everything in it! I cried, laughed and was amazed all throughout! Very well-done! Please do not let it end yet. This drama drives me crazy. At the last episode (#20) I began to drown in a deep drama-land despair. But then I came up for air when in episode #21, Ae-Shin puts the ring on Eugene\\'s finger and tells him she loves him, that she was always in love with him. I just want everyone involved in the production of Mr. Sunshine to know how wonderful this series is! The actors are awesome and I am learning something about Korean history! The trailer for ep 22 is heartbreaking.. actually the whole story is heartbreaking. I think we were all hoping for a “not so sad” end. the trailer for episode 22 hurt my hearts, what happen with eugene thooo, i hope he is alright:( I love this drama so much, even though I\\'m only at episode 9. Where can I begin? The interactions between the American-Joseon man, the Japanese-Joseon man and the Handsome Joseon man are sooooo cute and endearing. But it is also mind boggling because they have reasons to hate and kill each other, but are somehow pulling themselves back because they see some friendship value in each other? And I hate where this is going because I /KNOW/ our love for these 3 and seeing them hate each other and tear each other apart is going to stab our hearts:( Sometimes I even find myself wishing there was no female lead to begin with and we\\'re left to see how these 3 men live their lives... I love, love , love this show. The story is beautiful, I love all the characters. Can’t wait to see the last two episodes, will there be more! In love with Gu Dong Mae ....And the drama is lit as expected . Eugene better not die I cried last Sunday when she dumped him and he said to her he will die if he can\\'t see her this better than the Notebook but I don\\'t see how she stay in Korea when the Japanese take over she should go with Eugene Still praying for a happy ending!!! I think it was ep 19 where Eugene said that this story had no happy ending so I think they are just getting us prepared for an unforgettable ending. 24 episodes? At least, phew its not only 16. Its going to end soon. I dont want this drama to end. I\\'m going to cry. T_T please let them have a happy ending. I want to see Go dong mae hace a happy ending:) The meeting between EC and AS I have a secret crush on Gu Dong mae\\'s right hand man, Yoojo. I love the story so far!! Its so nice that i\\'m not into historical dramas but now, i\\'m too addicted on this one. I cant wait to see the ending. the story kind of reminds me of the Philippine history, like KKK Katipunan, Jose Rizal and Andres Bonifacio- thingy, but of course, our country doesnt have a king.:) the Koreans suffered a lot from the Japanese same in the Philippines. For the sake of those who haven’t watch yet, I don’t want to spoil but cried both in the last two episodes. You’ll be furious and sad, not sure but maybe that’s just me.. Very impressed, overall, with this drama. Such a rare period to be focusing on that it is refreshing to me. As a critic concerning ethic origins of actors and they\\'re portrayal of characters (from any studio, and as an American, I note a lot of it), it isn\\'t quite as convincing though when the person portrayed isn\\'t of that ethnicity. McInnis is one. I\\'m aware of his USA birthplace, though he is 50/50 Korean/white so looking at him in the show isn\\'t completely convincing. The blue eyes helped. The Koreans that play Japanese is another example. Albeit, Japanese actors most likely wouldn\\'t want to act in this show, considering the vicious nature in which they\\'re portrayed later on (not saying the portrayal of Japanese soldiers in this period is right, wrong, correct, incorrect, etc). Also, a few of the white actors portraying Americans weren\\'t completely convincing, either. The school teacher seemed to have a little bit of some kind of accent... But, thinking about Korean drama in general, this one had a pretty impressive budget, quite demanding cast and extra needs, really enjoyable cinematography, and a decent plot. Most of the acting is solid. As Koreans are the focused audience, this show probably hit them hard with a lot of dazzle! As an American, I\\'m still surprised in a pleasant way with it and have been greatly enjoying it--despite little things I nitpick apart. Eugene is a fascinating character. Maybe this show will bring about some discussion and renewed interest in this sadly almost forgotten and understudied area in history. Despite whatever the end may be, well done with this drama! I think the ending will be bittersweat again like previous author work, they will meet again in 1945. After the \"Littleboy\" and \"Fatman\" do their work. Wow this drama is getting more interesting after putting that Mori guy .. gosh, i want to kill him myself.. Please...be happy ending.....please Damn. Trust me. I\\'m so ready for the sad ending. If i\\'m not mistaken the next eps preview, Ae-shin will come with Eugene but then she leave him because she can\\'t leave her country in chaos. And she promised Eugene that she\\'ll come back if Joseon already in peace. I don\\'t know if it\\'s wrong tho, but damn i still rooting for EuShin\\'s happy ending at least. Ae-Shin is really cruel! I hope she clarifies to Eugene that she deceived him about the destination not because she doesn\\'t trust him, but because she figured he would not help her because of how much danger she would be in. @the watcher - even after the attack on the Go family Mori went to the court to complain about Gunner Jang. The only way it makes sense is if Japan is totally confident that Korea is unable to protect itself. That\\'s why all of the Korean defenders are basically outlaws and Emperor Gojong has to assign people to fight Japan in secret. I\\'m guessing that if Korea made the war official then the entire country would have been destroyed. What doesn\\'t make sense though is why they attacked the Go family like they did. Lee Wan-Ik had set in motion the beginning of a non bloody take over starting with the destruction of the family, without force being needed. Mori clearly wanted to antagonize some people to draw them out, but it seems to have backfired, even though the takeover eventually succeeds. Looks like Dongmae have took Hee Sung’s wig from Six Flying Dragons xD It’s the best Korean drama in 2018. I enjoy and love it. It deserves to have a grand prize for the whole drama!!! @Chae Won, Any thoughts on why it\\'s called Mr. Sunshine? Sigh..just My heart hurts..... A lot of things not making sense in this drama, sometimes frustrated me and make me wonder if I should bother keep watching, I think I keep watching because dong Mae looked too cool. This is the 1st full Korean drama I have ever watched & it’s one of the best dramas I have ever seen in any nationality!! The acting is superb! Story is sad & even more so that it’s based upon true story. I am hoping Lee Wanik’s character along w/the Japanese Colonel are killed in the next episode!!! It will be Justice if Lady Go Ae-shin is the one who takes him out! It was so sad to see Haman killed but noble of Kim Hee Sung to finally step up. It will be interesting to see how Eugene & Goo Dong Mae work together to protect their love interest, Go Ae-Shin & hopefully fulfill her Grandfather’s wishes as well as their own agenda. With only 3 episodes left hate to see it come to an end! Will there be a Season 2? PLEASE DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVENT WATCH EP 19 YET I don’t know about history of korea in the 1900s. But I love this drama so much. Do not criticize it because it is just a creative drama not follow all the truth. It deserves to be the best Korean drama of the year 2018!!! Always wondering bout this. They always has a lot of chances to kill Lee wan-ik, but why they didn\\'t do it? And now this, ep19 making me go insane for real. How dare Mori kill Joseon peeps but still not declare as a war? i\\'m too uneducated for this shit Chae Won, now, after this insight, I have to watch all over again with different eyes!!!? Mori n wanik almost make me curse them Just watched #19. OMG!!! I think it has to said that through his association with Ae Shin, Eugene\\'s character began to change. He was becoming the noble man that Ae Shin had assumed he was. I wonder if there would have a family link between Ae Sin and Hee Na. Sistres or cousins The person putting pistol to Dong Mae is T Mori, the Japanese soldier, not Eugene. The uniform has a sleeve with gold with 3 black bands around it, Eugene\\'s uniform sleeves are simply black with a row of buttons. The safest place for Ae Shin is at the American Legation. The compound is as safe as an American embassy. Will she move there eventually? Lol! If she does, it\\'d be shortlived. @The Watcher: \". . . still no kiss scene.\" @The Watcher - If that was Eugene that Dong Mae judo flipped, the pistol held to Dong Mae\\'s face was not used by the Marines, but was issued to Japanese soldiers as was the uniform of Dong Mae\\'s attacker Japanese. I\\'m watching behind the scenes and lee byung hun seems to be more charming in real life than his character. The next eps previews is like the changing of ships. How Dong-mae flip Eugene and makes Eugene looks weak (which means he can\\'t protect Ae-shin) and Dong-mae is the real one who can protect Ae-shin. Still, i\\'m rooting for Eugene and Ae-shin. Their love story is so sad. It\\'s ep18 and still no kiss scene, it\\'s just so sad. Everything about Eugene and Ae-shin is so sad. It\\'s just they are not fated to be together, and even if they are together, most people againts their odd relationship. Damn sad. in the end I think the one who ends up with Ae-Sin is NO ONE. I believe she will fight and die alongside Eugene. For Gu Dong-Mae, he will make the ultimate sacrifice and Hui-Seong will be the one to tell the world of their lives and how they have fought for a better Joseon. Lee Byung-Hun has so much charisma in this drama. I now understand why he is one of the most in demand Korean actor in the world. But the actor that strikes me the most in Mr Sunshine is Yoo Yeon-Seok. I mostly saw him in Warm & Cosy and Dr Romantic but this role, really has matured him and brought out the best of his acting. Flower boy no more. Here he is a man and super sexy! That Japanese yakuza costume really suits him. Kim Tae Ri\\'s character is also an unusual one and Kim Tae Ri acted it very well, from her dead-pan expression to her directness and no nonsense attitude. Very different from most female characters of KDrama (either insanely naive or insanely insane). The writers have done really well with the dialogue especially the interaction between the three male characters. I love this show so much! It has made me fall in love with Korean television. I think all three men who love Ae-Shin are so amazing. I love the humor as well. I only wish I spoke Korean (and Japanese) so that I could pick up on the subtleties and caste-level language variations that I miss by relying on the translations. The music and the love Ae-shin and Eugene Choi feel for each other is so pure it hurts!:) @ChaeWon @Carmen interesting exchange guys. Thanks! I\\'m Team Dong Mae by the way? @Chae won, thank you for explaining the reason for the Koreans\\' petitions! I wasn\\'t able to find any articles (in English) that explained the detailed reasons for their complaints. It sounds like they are being very offensive by choosing to make Dong Mae look noble for the purpose of entertainment. I don\\'t understand the purpose of distorting the truth and diminishing the crime against the queen. @CARMEN — In so far as Goo Dong-Mae is one of three male characters that have ostensibly developed a bond between one another, despite the apparent animus in their banter, yes, I believe I am rooting for Goo Do-Mae. However, I don\\'t think I can ignore the historical fact that the character that Go Do-Mae represents was insanely ruthless and morally reprehensible. @Chae Won Thank you for your insight. Are you by any chance rooting for Goo Dong-Mae? @questions about hair - I found out he did it because noble women are never supposed to cut their hair and it is a huge stigma. He is trying to protect her by forcing her to stay on her property. Obviously he doesn\\'t know Ae-Shin that well as I doubt that will have much impact on her doing what she wants to do. @CARMEN — I\\'m speculating that he cut her hair as a tactical move to force a neccessary change in Ae-Shin\\'s situation, in particular, the status of her relationship with Captain Eugene Choi. Ae-shin\\'s grandfather being the main object of his manipulation. @B they’re commenting on the way his name is said. In reverse order with the Americanized pronunciation of Choi. Which is said like Cho Hee in two syllables. That’s not the way you pronounce it in Korean. So when he introduces himself they heard Yoo Jin Cho Hee. Which sounds like two Korean first names without a surname. why did goo dong mae cut ae-shin hair off at the end of epsoide 17? What is the significance of Gu Dong-mae cutting a woman\\'s (name withheld for viewers who have not watched Episode 18) hair without her consent? Does it symbolize \\'ownership\\'? When Eugene introduces himself as the drill instructor, why are the students surprised he has two first names? Is it because it is uncommon outside of Korea to have two first names? Getting darker n uneasy #ep17 This drama would have been if sword fights are done swiftly. Why we don’t get a full body shots of the fight? @SQ2 — A Japanese gang of swordsmen thugs broke into the palace where Queen Min (Empress Myeongseong) was sleeping and savagely murdered her. Dong Mae\\'s gang represents those historical thugs, but the drama had made him appealing to the audience who sees that Dong Mae\\'s drew his blade on those who had violated an ethic or were cruel to others—the women who had mistreated his mother; two men who dared to impugn Ae-Shin\\'s honor. So, for romanticising the Japanese thugs, the petition was justified IMO. Also, can anyone tell me what the \"historical inaccuracies\" supposedly are? Remember the controversy about this drama, the petition that Koreans signed asking the government to get involved because the drama was inaccurate and made Dong-Mae sympathetic? I don\\'t know anything about this time period, and I\\'m wondering what\\'s factual? Episodes 15 & 16 have been my favorites so far. The series was beginning to bore, and I didn\\'t watch these until this Thursday because the characterization was lacking. Things are coming together better now, and for the first time I felt like the characters had depth. Ae-Shin was so pretty running through the woods toward Eugene. What a beautiful scene. I think I\\'m right about characters surviving to resist the Japanese. Hee-Sung\\'s printing in Hangul absolutely must be foreshadowing his involvement. I think Dong-Mae is safe at least until the end too because he must have a role as someone connected to Japan. Don\\'t ever believe what the previews show--they\\'re edited perfectly to increase your anxiety and make you watch next week. @Chae Won - I am not positive but I assumed the mountain he wanted was the one his parents were buried at. Epic! I\\'ve just started watching the first few episodes on Netflix and I am hooked. Everything in it is perfect. Considering that it is a drama, the attention to detail is unsurpassed. This is one drama where the antagonizing males said I think in their efforts to counter the Japanese advance on their power structure, Joseon\\'s approach according to the drama, was reactive when it should have been pre-emptive. There are a few foreign films that I have seen from time to time which are captioned in the English language. I will admit that Mr. Sunshine is by far the best foreign film that has captured my attention. I am at this point well committed to seeing it to the end. I have not missed the first 16 episodes and I can\\'t even imagine how it will all end. This is a well directed series in that it reminds us of the tragedies to the lower classes during that period in time and how one person from such sad and tragic beginnings found the strength to rise above it all. Needless to say, I\\'m rooting for both Captain Choi and Lady Ae-Shin. Thank you for allowing me to comment. Don\\'t let Dong Mae die, please author-nim..?? Writer-nim please let all main characters still alive till the end. Especially Trio Fanboy, I hope they had an happy ending. Cant wait for ep 16? i love this drama so much. Lee Byung Hun is one of my favorite actors. I\\'m surprised by the on screen chemistry of Lee Byung-Hun and Kim Tae ri but i am more surprised by the \"bromance\" of Yu-jin / Dong mae / Hee-sung... Oh i love every scene that they are together... i would say \" you three again\"... i really enjoyed those scenes... Everyone assumes there will be a tragic ending, but I\\'m expecting at least one character (maybe all of them) to survive and go on to be part of the independence movement that resists Japan. I think the Joseon yakuza members will secretly support Korea in their resistance. All the main characters could potentially have a future in that movement. I don\\'t see how a drama about this theme would end without foreshadowing the characters\\' involvement in the coming historical events. EPIC!MASTERPIECE! i think is one of best korean dramas i ever watched.Cant understand who is giving bad ratings. i guess kids only...Just hoping for good ending:) Gosh. How can i survive every week. Its darn difficult waiting for the weekends for a new episode . I just love it so much. Love the chemistry of the characters and yoo yun seok suits the look. Ughhh cant help but to watch it over and over again while waiting for the new eps. @yuki Big NO, Kim Min Jung is perfect as Kudo Hina, she can speak japanese and english really well also her acting is too good to be a second lead Too many traitors in that time...we know Joseon will lost to Japan at that era. I wonder what is Ae Shin next move... would she fight for her country? Will she choose to save her love and leave just like her desire to go further/far away? According to this drama, and as I see it, Gojong was an incompetent ruler. And his father was worse. They handled things badly in 1866 when they sunk an American ship. Then when an armed American fleet came looking for their comrades, Joseon again without any provocation from the fleet, fired on the American fleet while the discussions were going on, on land between Joseon and the Americans. Why? No explanation was given that I know of. Abbie:::) @My03S2K I laughed when Eugene brought the potter (Eun-San) some US beer and Ae Shin asked Eun-San about the taste. Eun-San tried to dampen her curiosity. At the begining of ep 13 it looks sweet n lovely then the last scene like bang,the sadness is coming Well.. why is dong Mae drenching in blood?? I guess the real fight begins now. An accurate prediction @We call it Sniper. Saat ending in #13. @We call it Sniper — Given Eugene\\'s response, the other potential candidates besides his friend Joseph Stenson are; the potter Hwang Eun-San, his assistant Gwan-Soo and the pawnshop guys who saved him as a 9 year old runaway slave. The final scene song is really amazing. Does anyone know what is it called and who is singing it? Ta x @We call it Sniper: I like to believed you are right about Joseph\\'s hand. But I have a bad feeling something much worse going to happen, I do hope that will not be the case. I have a fairly accurate guess that the hand held by Eugene when he cried in Eps 13 was Joseph\\'s hand i love to watch this,, i can wait to watch next episode. hope it\\'s saturday already. so addicting.. So at the end of episode 12 they go off on their \"dirty weekend\". I thought that was funny after all that was said between them. They had resolved to part ways and it broke Lady Ae Shin\\'s heart. Then, I guess the biological pull was too overwhelming. Sorry but it\\'s funny and beautiful at the same time because it is very much like that in some real life situations. Role of Hee Na would better suit Kim Sa-Rang, sorry for her:( This drama is nectar. I so love all the main characters. actually i yearn for more bromance that the slave-noble woman love story. looking back at oska-joo won, kim shin-wang yo, yoo shi jin-seo dae young, their scene just so adorable. i always love when the scene turn to kim hui seong-go dong mae-choi eugene, they\\'re so funny. Im really glad reading such a warmth comment said tht they love this drma, praise the cinematography,the writer,the cast, seriously they deserve it. Cant wait for the 12th eps This drama is everything. From the cinematography to the acting....epic. The story is also amazing as well as the chemistry between all the leads. Big thumbs up This series is incredible. Even though I am an American, I enjoy watching international movies, especially period pieces, to see how different countries represent their joys, sorrows, defeats, success and interactions. I am so thankful for sub-titles; however, the exceptional acting in this drama, conveys so much more. Brilliant acting, cinemaphotography, set design and costuming. I am really enjoying each episode and this series has prompted a new appreciation for Korea and its people. I am anxious to continue reading and learning about her history. Thank you for airing this to an international audience. I decided to watch this drama because of Kim Eun-Sook and Lee Byung-Hun because I love them both. And as expected, I am not disappointed. The writer’s way of harmonizing drama, comedy and romance is what makes her stories addictive. And I’ve always wanted to watch Lee Byung-Hun in a k-drama (first saw him in Hollywood movies where he does not tlak too much) and I must say, I love his deep, manly voice. I was head over heels in love with Goblin, but I am definitely loving this too! A. Must. Watch. @Tas. When families in Asia arranged marriage, usually their babies are born the same year with each other. Then the two families get together and making the arranged marriage for the new born. That makes Lady Ae-Shin 9 year younger than Mr. Sunshine, unless the story tell us how old Lady Ae-Shin is in the TV show. Please do let the age rest for Mr. Sunshine, because even today in Hollywood many people marriage +20 year older than their spouse. Calculating age I\\'m actually not really into Kim eunsok drama, but Mr sunshine is the except one. I know Lee Byung Hoon did an amazing act in here but i love more chemy of dongmae with aesin more, i love i love this drama even more bcs of that. Mr Sunshine hwaiting Oh God.... I love this drama so much, I understand why all the 3 men in love with Lady Ae-Shin. Lady Ae-Shin such a big inspiration. I think I want to learn shooting next year because of her. Kim Eun-Sook, I wish I have quarter of your creativity and imagination damn.. outstanding combination Kim Eun-Sook and Lee Eung-Bok definitely turned into brilliant outcome. Omgg I just love this drama sooo much! And the directors are the one direct in Goblin?? Orin: Yeah just like how all KES\\'s dramas second female lead. Yoo Rachel, Yoon Myeong Ju, Sunny are all great, they have strong characters. I believe Kudo Hina will get more screen time just like them. one more impression is Japanese dialogs! Beautiful drama with a great cast and awesome cinematography. I love this drama. Wish that I could understand the words of the songs -- so beautiful. I watch each episode over and over and all the You Tube (also wish they had English captions) @ X well aeshin deserve it if i were to criticize this drama, its about kudo hina. she is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too great to become second lead. and she didn\\'t even appear that much. she is such a strong character and i hope too see more of her in the next episode. please~~ This series is breathtaking, the story and cinematography are amazing. Gold! I love this drama so much. Too bad there\\'s only two episodes every week. I want to watch it everyday. I tried not to watch it and wait for it until episode 18 but i cant stop myself... Don\\'t see why anyone can criticise a 36 million dollar project. I must applaud the many good points in this show to do it justice: I loved Descendants of the Sun but Mr. Sunshine is even more wonderful. Visually captivating and I find the acting wonderful and compelling. Can not wait for episodes 9 thru the end. I realize it is a tough time in the history of Josan but find the telling of reality important to learn from past mistakes. Love in interaction between the 4 main characters and appreciate the feeling that the script and actors are not in a rush through some scenes. Sometimes quiet pauses speak louder than words. I just hate that there are 3 main actors after the one woman, it could be mooooooore interesting if there were 3 men and 3 women, this is just for me nah...in Goblin you had 2 men and 2 women, it was much more interesting that they don´t need fight each other because of love but here, here you could yet say that they fight each other or die for the woman just boring.... The storyline could be better done...! I start to watch this drama and I like it so much. I can\\'t wait the next episode. I hope this drama can reach the highest rating!!! I usually don\\'t like Kim Eun Sook\\'s dramas (Goblin and Dots were just not my cup of tea), but this one is truly done so well. The love complications do not feel too cheesy or soap operaesque. I also think a lot of it has to do with the cast, especially Kim Tae Ri. Loved her in every single thing i have watched, and this isn\\'t any different. She brings such a badass quality to the character it\\'s amazing. Also, the scene transitions are so beautifully done! Yes, to the comment below, about the scene with Go Dong Mae. This was the first series with YYS that I\\'ve seen. So after watching episode 8, I searched up everything else he\\'s in. Is this why some Koreans were supposedly objecting to his character, because he\\'s a self-seeking traitor, yet he\\'s portrayed in a sympathetic and attractive way? I know the whole romentic advancement between the leads was lovely.... But for me That train scene between Go Dong Mae and Ae Shin was way more intense and touchy:\\'( @alil Does anyone knows what song played on minute 4:17 of episode 8? I\\'m really dying to know the tittle T_T Now let\\'s learn the following letters!L for love,H for hug,K for kiss!Those three are important!Waitng for Aishin to show us the meaning of Kiss!Drama is exceptionally beautiful! Now I know the meaning and agony of \"second lead syndrome.\" By the way, I see comments about the samurai, but those aren\\'t samurai. They are yakuza. It was mentioned briefly at the beginning. It\\'s too bad that we always glamourize crime organizations in entertainment, but their costumes and hair are daebak! I can\\'t be the only one that sits on the edge of my seat during their scenes. This drama so great. I like the cast, i can\\'t imagine aesin being played by other actress. Kim tae ri just perfect act as aesin. Ep 8 leaves me in awe. Literally! The next days will be my longest days as I cant wait for Saturday. I love gu dong mae too???? Breathaking cinematography and amazing cast. I love the flow of story and I keep my eye in Kim Huisong, he is so hot . I love Ae sin she is full of sorrow and really strong woman in the story. 2 thumbs up for me My favourite character in this drama is goo dong mae...real bad boy in that era....??? K for Kiss ahahahahahaha I really want to see the bts on the \"hugs\" scene. I watched numerously. Damn they are good I love this drama but I really really want Goo Dong Hot Mae to have a real love story (not a one sided love). I wished with Ae Shin but its impossible so why not with Hee Na? There is that scene where she asks hims to protect her and he was really sweet with her and the way he looks at her while saying that her name is pretty... In love with this drama. I wait impatiently for the whole week to watch the 2 eps. An hour flies by when I watch this drama. The actors, their chemistry with each other, the story, the way it\\'s been directed and everything is just fantastic. If this drama were to be 50 eps long too I\\'d definitely watch it without being bored at all. Just love it. I recommend it to everyone and I hope this show gets recognition for what it is! Listen Dong Mae (yoo yeon seok) is such a great actor, he really lights up the screen and takes my breath away with his acting/expression. I do love Byung Hun and Tae Ri but Yeon Seok is on a whole \\'nother level. If you aren\\'t watching this drama I highly recommend, if only for Dong Mae cause thats why I\\'m watching to be honest:) Everyone, Everyone is exceptional in their roles but I have just fallen for yoo yeon seok.. he is so handsome and looks so hot in thiss samurai kinda attire. Eugene should be 40yo and Ae Shin is 28yo... So far 6th eps set the highest rating *frm 7 epsd @halakhannah I tell you guys this drama isss veeeeerrrrryyy recommended ooh IDK, I love chemistry of the actors???? good job lee byung hun and kim tae ri also the writer-nim kim eun sook Love the running gag about the 2 actors who kind of look alike and are mistaken for each other. I thought the same thing when I saw both of them in Goblin the first time(Kim Byung-Chul & Jo Woo-Jin). LOL!!! Who is it that keeps on using Ae Shin\\'s tab? Last time it was western style shoes and now at the bakery. The subtitles say Ae Shin used the tab in your name, when her servant is speaking to her, which makes no sense and makes it extra confusing. this movie makes me curious every episode... i personally didn\\'t like Lee Byung Hun but i\\'m surprised he and Kim Tae Ri play good chemistry so i decide to watch. But i really hope it\\'s not sad ending:))) @Mistah Sonshine The girl who\\'s with Goo Dong-Mae, the one who tells his fortune in an earlier episode, the same girl who writes something in his hand in Episode 6. She is Kim Yongji. She is a model and I\\'m very happy to see her acting in this drama. She\\'s gorgeous, right? Please support her^^ I\\'d recommend you to see vid in youtube, the title is Sentimental Scenery - Epic. Shon Minho and her starring in it. Sorry for my poor english hehe It\\'s a great drama and I\\'m madly in love with it & I can\\'t wait each week for only 2 eps;\\'( , It\\'s been a while since we saw such a perfect drama like this,, from All the sides it\\'s just a masterpiece, but I don\\'t understand why it\\'s still not popular enough internationally.. not many people watch it tho it deserves much better, maybe because it\\'s still at the beginning. So I hope it gets more popular and loved by the time and I hope its ratings keep breaking all the records. I think dong Mae Will die in the end,, the chracter like him always love someone in the silent and protect the girl till the end, and die without love,, so Saeguk type,, although a little, i hope ae Shin have loveline with dong Mae but that impossible bcoz knet sensitive about japan,, i\\'m so sad to see dong Mae eyes,, @Inter Fans the boybij the first episode is Gunner Jang. Young Dong Mae were appear in front of young Ae-Shin. Eugene left Korea when Ae-shin was a baby. So I think there is nothing wrong with the age gap. The user rating should be at least 90:\\')))) Deeply in love with this drama. Am I the only one who concern about age gap which is not between Ae Sin and Eugene but between Eugene and Song Mae. From first ep, we knew that Dongmae much older than Eugene, but in the present time suddenly Eugene looks much older than Dong Mae lol. Okay I\\'ll let this one director-nim (^^) @Ronald, I think it is Greensleeves Cant believe tht some ppl still talkin abt age gap Deeply in love wth this drama? What\\'s the real name of the girl who\\'s with Goo Dong-Mae? The one who tells his fortune in an earlier episode. The same girl who writes something in his hand in Episode 6. Thanks! kim hee sung has the saddest character. he may live in luxury, looks happy, jokes around with everyone but he\\'s empty all his life. its just my hunch, i maybe wrong but thats how i feel about him. Man it\\'s making crazy.eating for another ep is killing me.story just wow.drama mind blowing. Hi, You have two option: enjoy the drama or leave it. your argument about age gap not change about the cast LOL What a great drama!! Beat of my heart getting louder when Eugene gazed Ae-shin\\'s eyes.. @sarah best drama i ever seen in the past 5yrs......exceeded my expectation.....i was keeping it on hold and binge watched it this weekend and now i want more.....this writer has something special-a superior story teller .......like i have never seen such a huge diverse cast of this magnitude that delivers from start to finish I mean,,,wow. The age gap between my sis and mom is 15 yrs. While 25 yrs between dad and her. So, I find this a bit..uncomfortable? I really love this dramaa!! Kim Taeri somehow behave so cute, and lee byung hun is way too hot tbh and the writer of this drama Kim Eunsook writer, how can she think of a story like this, i love most of her drama.. she is a genius??? Best drama of 2018 shut up and just enjoy this drama. this drama is amazing! what\\'s with all the fuss about the 20 year gap? Kim Tae Ri is 28 for Pete\\'s sake!!! besides Lee Byung Hun may be near 50 but look at the guy he looks dashing and just handsome! I am a big fan of his.I have seen all of his films simply because he is such a brilliant actor! those who complain about the gap thing you are so immature besides the story is great! I don’t really care about the age gap, in fact during those times the husbands are way way older compared to their wives. The writer just portrayed what was actually happening during those times. This drama is superb, high recommended What are you all complaining about? Yes, they do have a 20 years gap in real but in the drama, they only have a 5 or 10 years gap between the characters. You all complaining when the girl isnt even 20 years old anymore. She\\'s 28 years old (29 in korea). The drama that disturbed me more was Goblin. I like the drama but whenever I thought about the girl being a highschool kid chasing a 30-yr.-old-something guy, it was like more a paedophilic situation for me than this. But no, nobody complained about that because Gong Yoo is a handsome guy unlike Lee Byung Hun who is referred only as a charismatic guy. Let\\'s not be picky on situations everyone. Isntead of complaining about the actors, focus more on what they deliver and what kind of drama they are making. The supporting character in Kim Eun Soek\\'s work always shining more than the lead. Like how i love Kim Joo Won\\'s secretary in Secret Garden and Gil Ra Im\\'s best friend by Yoo In Na who also more interesting in Goblin than Ji Eun Tak. As for this drama, i like Im Gwan So, an interpreter. By the way, his english is far better than Eugene. When dong mae tugged the hanbok I forgot to breathe. Whose idea was this damn is it just me who thinks that the lead actress is too young for Lee Byung Hyun? I\\'m just curious and tbh, I dont get it, it\\'s about that English Teacher. Why can\\'t she speak and understand Joseon/Korean languange??? Normally, of course, when you\\'re langaunge teacher, you have to know and understand how to speak both languange, dont you? But she? I just dont get it. best 2018 drama so far:) I don\\'t understand why some people think that LBH\\'s acting skill is lacking in this drama. I think it\\'s the character\\'s traits -- he is supposed to be stoic-faced, somehow cold, and oozes charisma all the time without having to overact like some other actors tend to do (I\\'m not his fan btw, this is my first time watching his drama). Well, but then again, maybe most drama-watchers prefer light romantic comedy dramas with overacting (mainstream) actors to high-quality dramas with actual storylines and talented people. I agree, june! I think series feels like a movie than drama series too! well, first time i don\\'t expecting anything, i\\'m just miss LBH acting. But in ep 1, i\\'m totally amaze Great cast and interesting plot. So far it has been so captivating, Really loving each episode. High budget movie like episodes and talented actors Lee Byun Hyun has impressive eyes in this drama. Whoever said must have been watching the drama witth their eyes closed. His eyes are so dull & boring and convey any expressions at all. Not only the eyes, LBH is frozen dead. I wonder what happened to it. Absolutely loving everything about this drama from the cinematography, the actors, the period setting!!! Also, I am reviewing each week\\'s episodes on my blog so check them out if you want!! So far am loving this drama. It just brings suspense at the end. The star cast is great and I love their individual roles. Fingers crossed for Eugene and Ae shin as anything may happen.This is my second drama of Hee na. The previous drama was Man to Man. Loved her act in that. Producers and Directors of Mr Sunshine, good job and keep it thesame way. Can\\'t wait for the next episode. I see that Mr Sunshine does not disappoint. The cast is simply amazing. Even the actors who have small parts do an amazing job! Everything is perfect and professional so I have nothing to complain about for now. I am very excited for the next episode! The earliest episode plot... Gave me this twirling feelings inside my stomach... I got this good feeling the drama going to be most great one for this year... It\\'s addicting! I want more... Hahaha... High quality drama! Kudos to all the actors. This drama deserves awards. It is not overrated. The scenery and visuals are beautiful. Highly recommended. Great! Can\\'t wait for the next episode. Can they have a film version of this? Lee Byung-Hun has such expressive eyes! Even when hes not saying anything its his eyes just tell the story. Incredible actor as always! Soo far this is a very high quality drama. a good plot, excellent lead actors, a strong woman character, wonderfully played and breathtaking cinematography. Did anone observe the chandelier in the GLORY HOTEL(in ep 4) , its the same one that was used in GOBLIN for grim reapers scene , where the dead have to drink the tea to forget about their past and ascend to their afterlife...it was said that that chandelier was pretty expensive . So this is what it looks like when you throw millions of dollars at a KDrama...not bad so far. Four episodes in and I am completely hooked. This show is up to its eyeballs in first rate actors and highly acclaimed writers/directors. My only worry is that it is sooo highly anticipated that no show can live up to the hype. Lol it’s gonna be really embarrassing if this didn’t hit like goblin or if there’s a drama that has higher rating than this with a low budget. Wewz they’re so confident with this drama let’s see... Like you, I find DOTS and her other dramas overrated. I am still planning to watch this one because of Lee Byung Hun, so I hope her writing on this one doesn\\'t disappoint me as well. Giving her another chance because this seems different. Been enjoying this by far. I just honestly and strongly hope that this is not another BS (yes, I meant bullshit) drama of this writer. Her DOTS was overly rated. It pisses me off every time I remember that drama. This one is different though. It\\'s good and I hope it remains that way. I love Kim Tae Ri since Handmaiden and I definitely respect Lee Byung Hyun\\'s acting. Everyone\\'s doing really good. Keep up! Prove that this won\\'t be another overrated drama. I\\'m 28 Years old and i like to date 50 years old ahjussi. It\\'s still age appropriate as long as there\\'s love and one of them not a minor. Cant believe tht im semi is dongmae\\'s mother. I saw her current drma, about time, n cant recognize her here so that im searching for it.?? The production of this drama is amazing. Smells like money, hefty budget we can tell - that\\'s the power of writer Kim Eun-sook and director Lee Eung-bok (both collab with DoTs and Goblin). The plot is very original and sometimes I am surprised by human creativity. The cast\\'s acting is really good. There\\'s a reason why Lee Byung Hyun is in Hollywood and why Kim Tae Ri and Yoo Yeon Seok (might know him from Romantic Doctor Kim)is a rising star. Even child acting these days is crazy, seriously too good. Ep 1 is very historically heavy but do not be put off by that. It\\'s necessary to understand the context. Ep 2 is where things get interesting and you will be sqeaming for more by the end of it. It already broke the ratings for highest first ep. Trust me on this one, it will not disappoint. one of the best kdramas!! Just 2 episodes into the drama and it’s killing it off already. Awesome Lee Byung Hun.. This Drama is really amazing.great Actor and plot. Cant wait for next Episodes. My Gosh descendants of the sun feel. Amazing start, it feels like i am watching a movie Great drama all in one...amazing story especially it\\'s historical military...great actor two thumb up to all of them..most especially the director,producer and the writer..the writer made a huge reseacher on the joseon history during american japanes...to my favorite korean actor and hollywood actor also LEE BYUN-HUN congrats... Okey .. PD Writer this drama always make any drama become HOTTTTTTT and FAMOUSSSSSS Lee Byung Hun is such a cool ahjussi and full of charisma..I cant wait for next episodes.Just as I expected this is an epic drama????? and Kim Tae Ri is so pretty and such a great actress their chemistry is oozing I was among the people who dont like Lee byung hun in this drama.. i wished it was Rain or Choi Siwon lol xD EPIC is the only word to describe this drama. It exceeds all expectations! Cinematography is off the chart, magnificent and next-level. Acting, WOW LEE BYUNG HUN. Talk about charisma. Talk about talent. OMG I CANT 5 minutes of GOO DONG MAE in Ep2 only were torture:( Cinematography- 10/10 The first two episodes brought me into alot of tears. Amazing! Really amazing. omg why do they keep casting a dad and daughter age gap? The ratings for the first two episodes are no joke.. High expectations for the next episodes. just watched the first episode and wooow. i\\'m surprised to hear how fluent lee byung hun in english. he\\'s definitely special. just by casting lee byung hun i know this drama is on a different level. and it is! Gorgeous! Epic! The music is soaring! Love this drama. Omg omo! This drama so epic! Fantastic baby! No joke bout director-nim and writer-nim. Actually I had checked one by one these casting and I find it interesting, because most of these were ever played on drama DOTS or Goblin or Six flyin dragon kkkk. Both cameo (Jin Goo and Kim Ji Won) played wife and hubby after two years of DOTS XDXD..it took me 4x rewatching their scene..just to make sure who was it..hahaha omggg i so excitedddddd. the scenery in this drama is so beautiful!! im in loveeee. *sorry for my broken english hehe* The Goo-Woo couple from the Descendants of the Sun! Omg i really excited for their cameo as husband and wife even for a brief moment? daebak, first movie looks great, love the act and casts:) the first episode was epic for me. i don\\'t know why people keep bashing lee byung hun and kim tae ri. i watched haindmaiden and kim tae ri was really good, especially as someone who new to this industry. Lee byung hun, what i knew is a high class actor. so this drama is no joke. i really love the timeline,love how they were showing us how the characters created, Hahaha it was so hilarious back reading the comments..why you guys fight over the actors? Relax, we got the best combo of writer and director they won\\'t cast in anybody just for nothing..as long as we got them, we will have a good show! So enjoy.. it\\'s the first episode yet, too early for your tantrum guys.. So far after the first episode, it was superb! Got a new kind of drama, and was surprise for the Americans, this must be very expensive! Haha Kim Tae Ri is one good, young & budding actor. I watched some of her movies...and this lady is one lady to watch out. She has the face & she is one with a great potential....just watch.... . ..i love byung hun.it nice to see him on screen again.i really like his drama like Beautiful days, All In and Iris @Isley, Byung Hun\\'s accent is actually not wrong at all. His character in the drama came to America when he was what? 5-10 years old? Those are the most fragile times in someone\\'s life for comprehending languages. His character had been speaking Korean only until he came to America, likely didn\\'t have many friends to talk to because of discrimination, and had to help the guy he was living with learn the language more while he himself probably only learned English in small ounces because I doubt he went to school. He was speaking Korean for the majority of his youth, so it\\'s obvious he wouldn\\'t speak like a native in English. Stop complaining about the ages!! Byung Hung oppa is the only korean actor can fluently used english and thats why he became the main lead... other kdrama actors english are not event fluent like him! ive seen other actors but i merely understand what they saying -_- you guys basically love those kdrama actors because they good loooking.. Let’s stop complaining about the casts anymore. It’s all DONE and nothing can change it:P Have you guys even seen the first episode before commenting? Not only was his english impeccable, but the acting was well done. Byung Hun\\'s english sounds way better than any other kdrama actor I have seen in a long time. Good drama so far. Big and beautiful. @Isley what???? Nam Jo Hyuk as the male lead among these seriously amazing actor as the second lead? Seriously? Yoo Yeon Seok and Byun Yo Han are no joke you know @Giuna — I agree that the actors I picked can\\'t speak fluent English to meet the demands of the character. But be honest Byung Hun is not speaking English like someone who grew up around English speaking people. He speaks like a Korean actor who grew up speaking Korean, attempting to speak English. @Giuna, Byung Hun\\'s spoken English is not fluent enough to be taken for someone who grew up around English speaking people. We can let him off, he\\'s doing his best. And I grant you; the actors I recommended are worse. @Isley. You don\\'t seem to be understanding that Byung Hun is literally one of the only people who can play the lead role of Mr. Sunshine. The lead in Mr. Sunshine is a Korean man that GREW UP in AMERICA. You cannot replace Byung Hun with either of those actors just because of their age or how they look. They have broken English, and it\\'d just be too unrealistic if they were given the roles. Be logical here. Byung Hun is a great actor and has a decent enough English-speaking voice. Also, his age IS of the right age as opposed to someone who\\'s in their 20\\'s or something. This is a war story focusing on \"Mr. Sunshine\", and It\\'d be unbelievable if he were only in his 20\\'s. This is of a time when discrimination was part of everyday life (and yes, discrimination still happens, but back then was more horrid). You honestly can\\'t think the \"Mr. Sunshine\" gained enough respect in 10-15 years in America (since he arrived there around 5-10 years of age) meaning when he was around 20, to do the things he\\'s doing in the show. 30-40 is the perfect age. Watching the first episode on Netflix now. Damn damn excited?? have been waiting for this for past few months There is no need for concern about Kim Tae Ri, she will do just fine. However, the age gap between the leads is a worry and probably the result of a business decision. It will be a challenge to the efficacy of a romantic liaison. Here is my major concern: Lee Byung-Hun is 47 years old. Kim Te-Ri is 28 years old. I hope the writer does not try and tell me these two were childhood sweethearts. Or, looking at the people playing their younger-selves, two or so years apart in age. If this show tries to say that they have anything less than a ten year age difference, I won\\'t be able to take it seriously. It\\'d be funny if one of the scene, gong yoo came as goblin lol. He lives 938 years Well as i said the male lead (Lee Byung-Hun) is a great package. I just dont know if the female lead will do a great job too. I just hope that she will not ruin the whole cast. But I know they will not cast someone who dont know how to act. They did a great job casting in Goblin and DOTS tho. The Network is TVN with Lee Byung-Hun! Wow this is going to be a big hit. And the plot and genre is kinda interesting. As for my first impression Lee Byung-Hun is a great choice. agree with soksa, try to watch this because i byung hun, sincerely hope they not degraded him like they do with gong yu in goblin, wasting great talent, movie class actor to do cheesy drama I sincerely hope this drma will be success. I hope mny ppl will support n love this drma too. I think its been a while since the last time i watch this kind of genre. Definitely gonna watch this drama lbh & yys???? this drama will be a great drama as descendant of the sun or Goblin, @Seoksa you are talking nonsense. I\\'m just hoping the writer will do well because the cast is fantastic. Please be realistic and stay away from clichés scenes like in the Descendant of the sun or Goblin. When I see the cast, well.. I think i can\\'t expecting much from Kim Eun Seok jagganim this time. But i still hoping this production will be great anyway. Im 101% sure to watch this...cinematography is amazing and a powerhouse cast??? ..cant wait This is a stellar cast. I bet this is Kim Eun Sook\\'s biggest drama yet. It looks like a film! I am so excited for this. It looks like Byun Ho-Han might finally get a role here that can maybe come close to rival his portrayal of Lee Bang Ji. I hope he has lots of fun with this character. this is going to be an EPIC drama .. im beyond excited for this one.. i think this drama will go down in history for TvN Top 5 or Top 10, I can feel Bridal Mask/gaksital vibes in this Drama *O* Well that looks....bloody epic.. Daebak daebak daebak! The casts are daebak! DAEBAK! amazing cast and crew GOO DONG MAE FIGHTING!!! cant wait to see our lovely goo dong mae? Goblin vibes. No, thank you. Lee Byung-Hun, he is finally back on drama since Iris 1. Been waiting for this!! Reading so many negativ comment below that people dont like him as the main lead. Whats wrong with you?!? He is no doubt one of the best actor in Korea and the only asian actor that made it success in the state without knowing any kungfu. So excited for this drama!! LBH FIGHTING!! The latest teaser got me all emotional. Come here for Yoo Yeon Seok. Fighting. He\\'s one of the actors who gets less recognition regardless of his indisputable acting skill. I hope this drama will be his major turning point; to get more recognized in this industry. Fighting!! This must be cool there\\'s no many days left for me to see this amazing drama... Omg, I can\\'t wait to watch this drama, this is really epic!! The cast too, wow, daebak Most Awaited Drama of this Year Can\\'t wait..excited already because of the writer was my favorite writer-nim I’m already crying. I’ve been so long feel like it’s been a year by now. so excited for this drama!! Finally, a similar drama of Gunman in Joseon is finally out! It\\'s sad that Kim Sarang left. Kim Eun Sook has been bringing her second leads from previous dramas onto her new (better-received) dramas (Descendants Of The Sun, Goblin). The same director and screen writer of goblin it will be amazing like goblin taebak can\\'t wait So excited ughh why Sarang left:( I\\'m so saaaad now. I loved her sm. I\\'m gonna be annoyed the whole time watching that actress from man to man. like seriously the amount of annoyance is to the roof. thats only a teaser... damn,, cant wait... i am still confused is Yoo Yeon-Seok the lead or not??? That trailer gave me goosebumps. It looks about as high budget as an action/history film in the States. I’m super excited!!! I am her for Kim Tae Ri. Her acting is beyond awesome. I love her personality too such an brightful and bubbly actress ❤ Yoo Yeon Suk and Byun Yohan are one of my fave actors. Will wait for this Kim Ji Won and Jin Goo having a cameo? omo!!!!! OMG, look at the teaser it\\'s so epic-looking and beautiful. The production is going all out on this one. GOOSEBUMPS!! THE.TEASER.JUST.MADE.MY.DAY i will give some spoiler that ship is USS Colorado not Joseon Ship cause i think they are using junk ship that\\'s why they loss in terms of techology between US so hopefully TVN will not mess up this one i know they are good making drama. Most anticipated drama of the year.. Such a great cast. Looking forward to see these amazing actors and actresses together on screen. Omg the teaser is so daebak. Omg the teaser is so daebak No Kim Sa Rang?? Byun yo hann?? Whoever the actors/actresses, if it\\'s Kim Eun Sook nim as the writer & Kim Eung Bok as the director, I am in. DOTS and Goblin are more than enough reason for me to watch this as well. I hope this drama is action than comedy! Omaya. Even without Taeri and Byunghun, I\\'m already dead looking at Yeonseok and Yohan images. MUST WATCH. Killer casting, killer writer. All-KILL. At first I wasn’t interested in this drama because of the lead actor. But I’m here for Yoo Yeon Seok so I’ll give it a try. Yoo Yeon Seok’s acting has never failed me, he’s actually good and should be recognized by the public. Plus I also trust Kim Eun Sook’s dramas. Fighting Mr. Sunshine!? I agree with kokonoright!!! I loved my taeriyakki in \\'The Handmaiden\\' and even before I watched it! She\\'s simply amazing. I love her very much; I can\\'t wait for this!? 24 episodes??? Never knew any TvN dramas with more than 20 eps before. Be anticipating this I am here for LEE BYUNG HUN. He is an amazing actor. Hope this drama will be a masterpiece❤❤ Im so excited my oppa Yo han is cast in this drama, hope his name will shine through this dram, and i hope he can have official instagram... LOL. SBS seriously let go of this project? watching it for kim tae ri! i loved her in the handmaiden! acting skills on point! I\\'m here for Byun Yo Han. I don\\'t really like Lee Byung Hun and as much as I know some of actors/actresses, I am not familiar with them...but I am such a big fan of the writer, Kim Eun Sook-nim and now the director too because he teams up with the writer since DOTS....beside a movie by them may have cameos from DOTS or Goblin hopefully.... 2017 and people are still so shallow minded over age gaps. Yet if Byung Hun had a flower boy face, and the 20 year age gap was still there, barely anyone would complain. There wasn’t another actor that could’ve been cast as the male lead? The age gap is too severe... They should’ve given the lead role to yoo yeon-seok or byun yo-han instead of lee santa, honestly. I was really looking forward to this too because of yoo yeon-seok, but i’ll skip it. Is this still going to premiere? there\\'s no news about this anymore This is almost unbelievable ...Kim Eun-Sook writer Lee Eung-Bok director and Lee Byung-Hun doing his first drama in 7yrs if this is amazing.. YYS? I think this will do good this drama, the cast are going to do great I love alittle war story next year and I hope that I get the chance to watch it so fingers cross for the anticipation. Lee Byung Hun is a very good actor. He is good-looking too. I think his role is not easy, but he knows how to act. You don\\'t know how Lee Byung Hun acts so perfectly in historical films. Try watching some movies of him and I bet you would like to watch this. I am watching this for sure. 2018??:O the bad choice of hero... already give bad impact.. so disappointed? tvN? Wow! This is going to be another great hit and this is going to break rating records!!! Completely agree with the comment below me. I\\'ve seen countless dramas where idols from boy groups/girl groups are present, and are given the chance to act. 97% of those idol actors are terrible, yet people praise it because \"Oh my baby\\'s so good looking!\", or \"She looks so pretty!\" This is exactly why many of them aren\\'t given the roles of leads. Haha... As expected. Most audience of Kdrama and Kpop are just into look, so an actual actor who can actually deliver his character is disliked. But on the other hand, they go crazy for a goodlooking and tall actor who can\\'t act for sh*t. Kdrama and Kpop is becoming big, mostly because of the celebrities aesthetic appearance. Big fan of Kim Eun Sook. Love all her works. Sadly, not a fan of Lee Byung-Hun, so probably going to skip this one. Love Yoo Yeon-Seok, but still not tempted to watch. Boo hoo. I really hope Yoo Yeon Seok to be the lead actor.. too bad. Please airing in tvn... Please airing in mbc, Kim Tae Ri is so damn amazing! I watched her in the Handmaiden and she is like out of words actress Incredibly fantastic acting, I\\'m looking forward to this drama!!! I don\\'t know to watch this drama or not... I don\\'t like lee byung hun, but I like other cast especially Byun yo han..... well just waiting until the dramas aired and if this good then kim eun seok project before (but DOTS and Goblin really great)....I will watch lol So happy that Yohan finally got a new role and it`s exactly in this drama. I hope that this drama will give him another push just like Six Flying Dragons did. With this cast the drama is certrainly going to be watched. Yoo yeon seok will be playing as villains here ^^ Please believe me that this will be eun sook first drama that will flop like katy perry\\'s witness. I love the casting @Jin wow i\\'m forgetting about that Gentleman\\'s Dignity couple.. Their age gap is 19 years.. Too far but have a good chemistry.. i need Ryu Hye Young as second lead. How about Kim Minjong-Yoon Jinyi? Another couple by Kim Eunsook. They won best couple with 19years age gap. Just wait and let\\'s see about this drama:D So yoo yeon sook join taeri and lee byung hyun. I think the story will be a \"triangle love\" lol. Yeon sook love taeri and taeri love byung hyun hahaha. There are age gap everywhere. Taeri 27 years old, yeon sook 33, and byung hyun 47 hahaha. lmaooo i swear if they push for a love story.... it would\\'ve been fine if the age difference isn\\'t so noticeable, but the age difference is noticeable so to me I\\'d feel kinda uncomfortable watching them as a couple.. i\\'m already uncomfortable that she casted lee santa but whatever @MikaruMikaru agreed:0 wow the gap between lead cast.. 20 years.. It\\'s little bit too far for me.. Omg ive beem waiting for this,i love LBH he\\'s a phenomenal actor i dont care about his scandal.i just love him? Can\\'t wait for kim tae ri\\'s debut drama:)) the lost father and daughter story? Can\\'t wait till 2018????? LBH my man!! KTR my girl!! perfect drama:P lee byung hun and kim tae ri cant be main couple right?? because they have exact 20 years difference. Impossible in my opinion. I just \"WOW\" for Kim Tae Ri woah kim tae ri. movie stars. I love the female lead I just cant connect him with Lee Byunghun. Like he\\'s so old for her.?? I even hate the fact that Lee Minjung married him. Ugh great work at the handmaiden , i think its deserved for kim tae ri play the lead actress! she going to be top star after this because all we know kim eun sook have \"magic\" Kim Tae Ri? Wow! Not expecting that at all This is really big for her debut on TV. She\\'s going be a top star after this! I\\'m following Kim Eun Sook writer because I\\'m a fan of her works.. But this time I\\'m so disappointed with the lead male cast... I know that he\\'s a good action actor but I just can\\'t feel anything romantically towards him because of his scandals... TT LBH is an excellent choice for casting. I luv his work here in the US and I enjoyed his movie Master when it showed here in Los Angeles. LBH is a great actor and I\\'m looking forward to seeing him in a regular series. No matter how old he gets, LBH gets better looking and he stays in shape. Can\\'t wait to see this show. LBH is a great casting choice! Love him here in the US and it will be a treat to see him in a regular drama. Excellent actor and I like how he is aging line a fine wine. It seems that he just gets better. Really looking forward to seeing this drama. i\\'m not going to watch, i hope is won bin or kang dong won? he\\'s a good actor but i just dont like because his scandal? Lee Byung Hun is so good with romance and melodrama. Huhue. I want Kim Soo Hyun.?? I agree that LBH is great actor. But he is unlikeable because of his scandal, I think. So hope this drama to have great female lead and second lead Hey, all of you saying bad things about the lead actor. They never said it was all sunshine and happy for this drama did they? No. The plot doesn\\'t even sound like it\\'s a happy show. I\\'d much rather have an older man who actually looks capable of doing things, to play the part of a military man (especially since he\\'d need to know GOOD enough English), than some out of place flowerboy looking idol portraying a military man, with broken English that you fangirls like calling Oppa and fapping to. I don\\'t know if you know this, but this dude has been in the US for a long time. You can\\'t just cast some popular hot/cute guy to do this character if most of them can\\'t speak English well enough. And lucky for this show, this Korean man has great English. Agh, not him!!! too old, less attractive then this new and fresh faces and there are so many korean young and handsome actors who speak fluent English. I was so looking forward to this project after DOTS and Goblin i am sure whatevers waiting will be amazing but in my opinion and in my eyes he wont deliver that. So disappointing. Since it sounds like the main lead is likely going to have some English lines, I think Lee Byun Hun is a good choice. Though, when I first read the synopsis, I was thinking Taecyeon would be a good choice. For female lead, I just hope it\\'s someone that\\'s not like, 25 years younger than LBH. Someone like Han Ji Min. Other more fresh actor could have been Mr. Sunshine. not interested at all. Now the hype is gone. why LBH??? so boring ... why not choose so ji sub?? jo in sung? kim soo hyun?? or hyun bin? Just my opinion, jo in sung should be better choice for male lead.... Son Ye Jin as female lead please & Kim Rae Won/Jo In Sung for second lead male Disappointed with the male lead casting.:( I can\\'t feel any sense of sunshine from this actor. I hope they give dasom a role in this drama cause she acts good the only thing is she must play in a drama with popular actors to show her skills please give a chance to shine . I was hoping for Jo In Sung to get the role (ㅠ_ㅠ) Please for second lead is won bin , and make won bin a antagonist , close enough bro romance kim eun suk I want see won bin and lee byung hun fight for female lead I think kim min hee is good choice Omo...DAEBAK!!!...I just can\\'t wait to watch this drama...i got high hopes...Lee Byung oppa...fighting!!! Kim Tae-Hee for female lead is interesting for me if it happen. watch IRIS drama and I hate the ending. hope can see \"better ending\" for Lee Byung-Hun and Kim Tae-Hee although it\\'s happen in other drama and with other characters. woaaaaahhhhhhh,,,,,daaaeeebbbaaakkk Best News everrrrr! Lee Byung Hun OMG i am looking forward to watch this Drama! I really hope Gang Dong-Won to join the cast he is such an amazing actor! ♥ Lee Byung Hun is such a charismatic actor. This is going to be fun. Now that we have a mega top star as male lead, why don\\'t we have a mega top star, too, as female lead. I think it\\'s about time that Son Ye Jin goes back to dramaland, too. The time period when she was in The Last Princess is not too far from the time period of this drama. She\\'ll nail it. It would be awesome to have Jeon Do Yeon, too. If it happens, the drama\\'s gonna burst with acting masterclass. i failed at my guess for the male lead. anways i can see myself in with lee byung hun see him in masquerade Omg!!!!cant wait and the plot looks good??? WOW! Lee Byung Hoon back in dramas! Looking forward to this drama! And the male lead is Lee Byung-Hun.. i hope the male lead is Kim Soo Hyun or Won Bin.. Maybe Won Bin reject Again the offer.. But honestly Lee Byung-Hun fit the male lead criteria was searched for this drama.. And then i wanna know now who is the female lead.. i hope is Son Ye-Jin or Seo Hyun-Jin maybe.. Byung Hun\\'s comeback to the dramaland after 7 years! We need a Kim Tae Hee-Lee Byung Hun pairing to happen again please. Or Kim So Yeon will also do for the female lead. Iris feels yup! lee byung hun! from good, villain, rebellious, romantic... he\\'s a very good and versatile actor... fighting!! I think song joongki and park boyound would be perfect for this drama. Needless to say, he was very good in dos, needless to say, being soldier would be no problem at all. Park Hae Jin is the one!:) Song Hye Kyo and Kang dong Won such a strong couple If the male lead is Park Hae Jin, I hope the female lead will be Lee Sung Kyung. I love them both in Cheese in the Trap.:) Park hae jin\\'s smile lights up the whole room. And his wide range of emotions from his different drama is really great! Hopes he\\'ll be our man. And ohh, Choi Jin Hyuk would be a great choice too! He did so well in recent series, \\'Tunnel\\'! Park Hae Jin, yes please! I must say that man has the most mysterious face ever but once he smiles, bammm, the world gets brighter. i think han hyo joo for the female lead i have a strong feeling that the male lead will be park yoochun. why? heres my answers: Park Hae Jin brings out that bright aura and atmosphere. He\\'s my Mr. Sunshine. Haejin Park - man to man i think the lead male role must fluent in english because he stay in america why don\\'t the writer cast a korean-american actor like daniel henney or lee phillip. i like to see one of them as a male lead role.... i looove to see one of them play in the drama again,,,, I hope it\\'s Park Hae Jin. ❤ Park yoochun and park shyn hye I beg you Yes, please pick Park Hae Jin oppa. I love him in all of his works. I think he will be the perfectly suited Mr. Sunshine. He looks good in a military outfit and he speaks good english too! He had long English lines in Man to Man <3:) Park hae jin as mr. Sunshine and Lee sung kyung as the female lead! Daebak! Park yoochun Writer Kim nim, would you please consider versatile and talented Park yoochun for the male lead role.Alongside with Daniel henney perhaps? kim soo hyun or jo in sung or parkyoochun Song jongki and park bo young Park hae jin please:)) Jo insung and Son Yejin juseyo pdnim, swnim!! Guys I am sorry but please not park shin hye.. .... Park hae Jin and shi min ah please! ❤️ It will be interesting if the female is Yoona and male lead is Park Hae Jin!:)) My casting,Seo Kang Joon or Park Hae Jin and Kim soo hyun?Yoona,Eun hye or Shin Hye? i hope its Won Bin I have strong feeling that it will be Park Hae Jin:) <3 Hyun bin -Jun Ji Hyun or Kang Dong Won and Song hye kyo I really hope it\\'s Park Hae Jin. I think he\\'ll be the perfect fit. He did great long english lines in Man to Man too. ❤ Pd nim choose park hae jin he is really the lead in this role If the writers follow the story line accurately, then the lead actor would have to be able to pull off a decent American accent since he would have grown up in the United States. The only actor I can think of, off the top of my head right now, that could honestly pull off a believable and not cringy version of an American accent is Taecyeon because he was raised in the states. My vote is for a Taecyeon and Park Shin Hye pairing. They were so cute together on 3 Meals a Day! I hope it\\'s Park hae jin:)<3 Male Lead: kim Rae Won/Song Seung Hoon/Won Bin/Hyun bin (mature actor) Park Hae Jin please! <3 Something about Park hae jin\\'s aura makes him the perfect choice as Mr. Sunshine.:) Good Luck .... PD WRITER ... You will make another hit drama .   tbh the appeal of Park hae jin suited this one. Park hae jin please pd nim Hyun Bin please HUHUHU .. Who\\'s gonna be lucky Female lead & Male lead get work by this famous PD Writer Drama!!!! Park Hae Jin! Yaaaas! She\\'s looking for an actor with great acting skills. It\\'s no other than Park Hae Jin! ❤ I hope lee joon gi gets a chance to play this role and work togehter with kim eun sook, he was a great actor with amazing skill remind me to Operation Chromite film...about the boys from S.Korea go to America and return to S.Korea. but, different years/era.... Lead actor: kang ha neul Lead actress: #1Song Hye Kyo, #2Han Hyo Joo Kim rae won as male lead Park hae jin is the best option! ❤ Park hae jin!! For the main lead please cast Cha Tae Joon and Park Shin Hye....HAHA Hyun bin please please choose kim soohyun as the lead male writer-nim! ^^ We need very \"current \" and popular actor that comfortable speak English/ adlibs . And will do well in action. Pls give Park Hyung Sik another chance to show his hidden talent as lead . Gong hyo Jin!!!!!! I want musical actor kang dong ho .... To be lead.. I swear u wouldnt Kang sora and jo in sung pleaseee!!! Or yoon eun hyeee Kang Dong Won or Jo In Sung please.. Won Bin please Could you bring back Won bin to kdrama land please? Its been so long. Lee Joon Gi or Yoon Si Yoon!!! I can\\'t think of any actor playing this role. But then I saw someone commenting Park Hae Jin. Hmmmm. I think he\\'ll do well, he can portray different characters based on the diversity of his dramas. I think he\\'s not bad.:) Park Hae Jin and Kang Sora. Let\\'s bring back the Doctor Stranger 2nd male and female lead! jo in sung male role please ....kim so hyun or kim sae ron female role please please please omg no park hae jin. too much of him these days. He doesn\\'t have that sunshine feel. please cast a young fresh face. Since they are looking for a versatile actor, I think Park Hae Jin will be the best option. Yoon Eun Hye and Jo In sung please~ Kim Soo Hyun for the male lead please and for the female lead I want Song Hye Kyo, Jun Ji Hyun, Seo Hyun Jin or Park Shin Hye. And please cast Kwon Yuri for supporting actress. Park hae jin oppa! It will be a hit. I guess I\\'m the only person who would like to see Song Joong Ki as the male lead. Park hae jin is the perfect lead! He is one of the most versatile actor we have right now, not just those cutesy cutesy ones. ❤ Park Hae Jin!❤❤❤ Ur drama always had a good and amazing plot, writer.. park bogum as lead male please❤ The plot sounds really interesting already! As expected haha. I would love to see Kim Yoo Jung in one of KES\\' projects! Or maybe Han Hyo Joo with a more important role. W didn\\'t do her justice. Lee jin wook, miss him in new drama For the lead female: Jun Ji Hyun / Han Hyo Joo Won bin would be perfect cause he is cool , manly Won Bin & Jun Ji Hyun or Gong Hyo Jin & Gong Yoo Kim soo huyn park shin hye Jo In Sung, Won Bin, Kang Dong Won, Ji Soo, Yeo Jin Goo, Jo Jung Suk, Lee Jong Suk, Lee Dong Wook, Yoo Seung Hoo or Kim Soo Hyun?. For the female lead Kim So Hyun, Park Shin Hye, Park Bo Young, Gong Hyo Jin, Yoo In Na? park yoochun male lead Park Hae Jin will be the perfect Mr. Sunshine lead! <3 Please cast him. male: Joo Won, Park Yoochun, Lee Jong Suk, No Min Woo, Yoon Gyun Sang, Nam Joo Hyuk, Park Seo Joon park bo gum or kang haneul!! Kim so hyun and Yeo Jin Goo would be a great partner since both of them are child actress that grew up really well <3 please.. take Cho Seung Woo and Son Hye Jin .. they are the best couple ever Please cast kang dong won and Jun Ji hyun Kang sora pls I think Kim Rae won is suitable as male lead and Song hye kyo / yoon eun hye as female lead Cast lee jehoon pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee Hopefully Han Hyo Joo and Jo In Sung/Kim Won Bin will be the lead Female and Male Yoon Eun Hye as female lead pleaseeeese ❤❤❤❤ please cast ryu jun yeol...acting wise even a newbie actor and speaking good in english may be next KES favourite Wonbin.J Insung n K Dongwon Yep! Park Yoo Chun/Jo In Sung and Han Hyo Joo please!! I miss Yoochun and In Sung on small screen. Please cast kim soo hyun and park shin hye . I think they will have good chemistry Of course this drama will be daebak!! Good Luck find Lead male & Lead female . I\\'m glad to hear this news, although this drama will be airing next year but I\\'m really looking forward to it. I agree with the others I hope in your next project you work with Gang Dong Won and I hope the female lead is Yoon Eun Hye. After working with Gong Yoo in the previous drama, I hope next Yoo Eun Hye. Her acting ability is no doubt, I miss her acting so much. Please consider my opinion Kim Eun Sook writer\\'nim and Lee Eung Bok PD\\'nim. I hope your drama will be a big success like the previous dramas. Thanks ❤ Writer Kim Yun Sook mom, would you please consider Park Yoo Chun as the main lead since you said you are looking for a good actor to play the role. He speaks good American accent well. Please consider. May you grant our wish come true. Thank you Gang Dong Won & Han Hyo Joo is perfect couple,perfect visual, great acting, they both super stars.this making great ratting, please writternim accept they both.i want this airing/ network SBS I hope it will be a hit like your other works? This drama will surely be anticipated because the director and writer are really in making dramas Kang dong won and jun ji hyun',\n",

       "  'comments': 'This has to be my favorite role that Ha Seok-Jin has played. Somehow, he has a much more sincere and playful look about him. Such a great drama for intertwining stories. Kwon Jin Kook and Sang-A are really cute together. I love their scenes, funny but also awkward. Ha3. I really like this drama. Will watch it again someday. Heart-warming story... nice cast except for Bona. I cringe at her acting. Sorry. This is a light melodrama and honestly, it covered ALL the bases for me. I loved it so much. The relationships were extremely rich and fulfilling - the love that everyone had for each other grew naturally and beautifully as we go through each episode. Everyone had a character arc. They took their time fleshing out each character and building solid relationships, looking past societal roles and taking a more honest look at how human intimacy is developed. This drama isn\\'t finished yet. and I\\'m still waiting for the continuation. My kinda drama to spends lazy time lol, so light and warm, there’s no villain in this drama, everyone get together in perfect harmony and happy ending, that’s important lol. But the storyline bit different which published, about Ji-Woon and his parents. Ji-Woon worked at the bank before become the house helper also he wasn’t from the rich family and his parents already died in the accident (based on his strory to Da-Yoon). It\\'s very simple but I enjoyed watching it Update for Na Hae-ryung who makes special appearance in the beginning of the episode. Very great drama! I learned a lot of things to clean some things that I thought right, and fixing things:) Thanks to this drama. Great actors and actresses. So sad because it is so short. It\\'s good drama.I liked Go Won-Hee model scene. That was good. One of my favorite korean drama! Salute to Bona and Ha Seok Jin!! Seriously one of the most beautifully produced dramas I\\'ve ever had the pleasure of watching. From a wonderful and almost lyrical script to a solid cast that fit their respective characters perfectly, a catchy soundtrack that carries the viewers on a journey of emotions to masterful storytelling/directing, every minute is worth your full attention. Aww only show wanted for like maybe another 10 more episodes see their love more. Cut too short TBH I really love this drama....simple yet we engaging❤❤ I wasn\\'t follow WJSN at all so I didn\\'t know Bona before I saw her in this drama. To be honest, looking at the cast (before the premiere of this drama) I haven\\'t expected much from Bona as an actress... In the past I saw some good acting of K-Pop idols in K-Dramas, but some of them disappointed me on TV screen as well... I must say that for me Bona is a very positive surprise! She doesn\\'t overdoing her acting (like some other idols do) - she created very natural and convincing drama character. If Bona wasn\\'t a girl group member she could choose career of an actress as well. I look forward to see Bona in some future drama. I\\'m aslo happy to see Go Won-Hee (SangA) - I remember her from \"My Dear Cat\" where she was playing one of my beloved characters. Generally I love the story of friendship between the four main girl characters of \"Your House Helper\" - I\\'m a man but somehow it\\'s really nice and moving to watch girl\\'s friendship (for example I had the same feeling watching the \"Jugglers\" drama). I sure will save a very good memories about \"Your House Helper\"! i luv this drama so much even there still has some boring part..hope will have another season.... I haven\\'t still watched the last two episodes, so i don\\'t know if the ending could change my impressions. However the drama is quite enjoyable, i would recommend it to everyone that wish to watch something not too dramatic or chaotic. Excellent cast choice, IMHO. They portray the different characters really well, without an overboard acting (so, in a very realistic way). Ha Seok-Jin never disappoints, and all the actresses worth a praise. I love Go Won-Hee and Bona, but even Seo Eun-A and Jeon Soo-Jin delivered a convincing and touching acting performance. A little bit draggy the storyline. A simple story with lot of lessons. I love how Mr Kim gives some tips to clean and organize the stuff, icluding my life. Kekekeke. I loooooove this drama, very refreshing and warm. Yes, this is not a roller coaster and complicated drama, but I love it. Simple, yet warm and touching. And Bona made alot of progress in her acting. I love her acting in Girls Generation 1979 and she\\'s doing well in this drama too. Great drama? I really in love with this drama!! A good story with good side story. I love how charismatic kim jiwoon character, Ha seokjin has a really amazing acting. I think Bona\\'s acting is mediocre tho, but I can still felt how warm dayoung character is, but for the chemistry its not rly strong. i really love all of the side story, sang A story, hyejoo and somi story. So fresh having a drama that brought up about lgbt stuff, trauma and dragging people just bcs their gender and status (Mrs. An story) and sexual harassment (dayoung\\'s case) i really love this drama and the actor/actress acting. the fact that this drama bring social issues make me love this drama more and more. this drama always makes my heart fluttering just by watching the way Jiun look at Dayeong. I love the way Jinguk being straightforwarded towards Sana. The mystery behind Somi’s pastlife & the conflict about Hyeju and Cheolsu. Manager Ahn being protective about woman’s right. I love the plot and casting. This drama never failed making me smile by watching every episode. I have high expectation about this drama. Because of this drama, i clean my house oftenly! @someday. \"make-up is too much...\" I watch this drama because of Ha Soek Jin, he is my no.1 korean actor. He looks expensive even in poor situation. He is suitable for his role in this drama. For Dayong, why her make-up is too much, that destroys the mood of story, looks over not real. Watching this drama I want to clean my room right now.. I like the story especially the lead actor, such charisma; but am not particularly happy with the choice of the lead actress Bona, she has no screen appeal, no chemistry with the lead actor. She is flat. I can realate a lot to this drama , its a good drama TuT Watching this drama is quite relaxing. May be the plot is not too \"roller coster\" but i still enjoy this drama And the main actress is quite cute.:) I\\'m more interesting with Kwon Jin-Kook and Yoon Sang-A relationship ^^ hahaha theyare so cute and funny. Awesome relaxing show..Ha Seok Jin really aces in this title role..The cleaning scenes and his dialogues in them stand out..So does the music -Cat owner by ABRY is very catchy @RIGHT I have the same opinion as u! bona and joy\\'s acting was natural to me! It might be because most of the actors in my country don\\'t really act well so I find that their acting isn\\'t as horrible as how the netizens perceive. Love kwon jin kook and yoon sang a @Ziana. bad!!!! well it\\'s ur opinion. for me her acting was natural. she might lack in some scenes which is understandable because she wasn\\'t experienced enough but overall she delivered her role so good. idols-turned- actresses are usually criticized for their high tone when delivering their speech but this problem Joy could overcome it. saying she\\'s not even above average isn\\'t fair at all. the improvement she made in just one year between her 2 dramas without taking acting classes and with crazy busy schedule should be appreciated. some critics consider her as one of the rising idol actresses which means she is good. Love Bona since Girls Generation 1979 @RIGHT i agree with the point about Bona but Joy being so great in The Great Seducer? Na uh not so. Her acting was not horrible but still not above average. Lukewarm acting at its best. I didn\\'t enjoy The Great Seducer for its all-over-the-place plotline and how less exciting the drama got as the episodes went on. Her character wasn\\'t even annoying me, cuz if there were any characters that were being annoying those would be Choi Soo Ji\\'s and that physchotic guy\\'s characters. Her character wasn\\'t at all annoying but her acting? umm bad This drama is so underrated. I don’t know but I just love all the celaning scene. Sang-A>>all other female characters. @Rc137 you\\'re absolutely right. Bona in the previous drama was so good even better than the 2nd lead who is originally an actress. it depends a lot on the character. people tend to hate the weak character. Joy was so great in the great seducer and delivered her role so well. but her character was somehow irritating plus the plot was a mess itself and the director work sucks. both Joy and Bona as rookie actresses are so great and will be better in the future Is Bona speaking with dialect or Seoul accent here? I just finished GG\\'s \\'79 and i\\'m planning to watch this next week huhu The last scene was sooo DDANGG!! OMG my precious baby Bonaa..:\\')) Finally I can feel romance between them two. Can\\'t wait for the next episode! My ship is sailling... The last scene what the .. is little cringe and I expect that will happen , I don’t like it it’s look so fake , and that not even happened in the real life to feel touched ㅠㅠ.. That last scene...omo omo. What an ending! Nice! now I have to wait until next week.The house helper is so hot! At early episode of the drama,I admit there was no chemisty between the two leads.But not until I saw the ending of ep 6...Like! seriously,it gives me so much butterflies in my stomach!!Like,i\\'m grinning from ear to ear,it was a cute scene.Now I can smell romance!!! why did everyone said that jiwoon and bona didn\\'t get the chemistry? im in episode 6 rn, and from the start i REALLY REALLY like the main lead act. i feel the chemistry beetwen them;)) all i can say that not all lead actress need to get tough act right? i mean not every person that have a characters like that OMG OMG OMG THE ENDING FOR EP 11!!! Bona is an alright actress. Her character is quite annoying tho... Her voice sounds very weak and not developed I guess? Overall this is an okay drama. My favorite couples are Kwon Jin-Kook & Yoon Sang-A; they\\'re too cute. The short hair/tomboy friend Kang Hye-Joo is funny. hehe Until ep.9 I still cannot feel the romance chemistry between Ji Won and Da Young. However, i can feel more chemistry between Ji Won and Sang A. Maybe because their character is really match and balance each other. Ugh now I cannot imagine if Ji Won falling in love with Da Young, that would be weird. Better if there is no romance at all. Just care each other between them as a group of friends. I know Bona from The Best Hit and Girls\\' Generation 1979. She was great at GG 1979. In this drama, she\\'s lack of something. It\\'s not that bad. Perhaps there are so many pro actors/actresses in this drama, thus so many people will leave no good comments for her. Regardless, I\\'m anticipating for her improvement in the future. I hope people don’t complain about Bona’s acting and getting a lead role just because she is an idol, rookie actress, don’t like the script or the director’s interpretation of how the character should behave. Joy (Red Velvet) got a lot of criticism due to all 4 reasons. Joy’s acting in “The Great Seducer” was “top notch”. Bona is doing a great job in her new drama. Bona is playing an intern. Lower than the lowest on the totem pole. Gets all the grunt work and no credit. I like this drama even tho watching bona do all of this disgusting things so that she can get the job but it\\'s a drama and I think that it is a good thing to include these kind of situations cause I think that it does happen in real life in korea ... I got stressed out watching this drama. I kept on saying to myself \"she\\'s so stupid\", \"she\\'s damned stupid\", \"why is she so damned stupid!!!\". It\\'s not that I have anything against Bona... It\\'s just that her character is my pet peeve as she is so cloddish. I would still continue watching it because of Ha Seok Jin though. But if her character gets unbearable, I would probably have to let it go. I dont ever think that bona\\'s character in this drama is weak, as her character, i think i can relate with myself or other people. Look at her situation tho, she doesnt hv enough money so she had to control her feeling and endure all obtacles that she had, it means she has no choice. I know someone like her will get back what she deserves, trust me! Finally theres a life saver urgh:\\'))) Love to see another Bona\\'s drama. I really like her acting since The Best Hit and especially Girls Generation 1979, her acting really good in Girls Generation 1979. People who blame her acting, you guys must watch her preview drama, because in this drama her character is not to stand out than the other, she is just a hardworking intern, that\\'s all. So just appreciate her because she is doing really good. And one thing that I really like in this drama is the romantic side of the main couple! Seriously, as Bona\\'s fan I never really ship her with another actor/idol. But in this drama, Ha Sok Jin is just too cool! I really ship Im Dayoung and Kim Ji Won! Hope the drama give more romantic story beetwen them two! Bona\\'s acting had improved alot. Love this drama. Can\\'t wait for the next episodes. Love to see another Bona\\'s drama. I kinda really like her acting since The Best Hit and especially Girls Generation 1979, her acting really good in Girls Generation 1979. People who blame her acting, you guys must watch her preview drama, because I think in this drama her character is not to stand out than the other, she is just an hardworking intern, that\\'s all. So just appreciate her because she has doing really good. And one thing that I really like in this drama is the romantic side of the main couple! Seriously, as Bona\\'s fans I never really ship her with another actor/idol. But in this drama, Ha Sok Jin is just too cool! I really ship Im Dayoung and Kim Ji Won! Hope the drama give more romantic story beetwen them two! Lol he come clean and organize my home any day the premise of the drama is very interesting but it takes a very small part of the show.the main female lead cannot act. This drama is really nice and light as of ep 8! The story line is very intriguing and I can\\'t wait to find out more abt the back story of almost all the characters! I am really enjoying this drama and I binged all eps in one go! It’s a real easy watch with a good storyline and dramatic premise. Characters all being developed each with their backstory slowly being revealed; it’s a real joy. However Bona’s character is the weakest link in this and that’s not her doing that onus is on the writer. I think that bona\\'s acting is good as an idol I came here because I want to make sure who the main female lead is. I was hoping that Im Dayong is but she doesnt seem like one, becaus her acting is so weak and her character doesnt stand out at all. She look like just another extra . There is a difference between acting like a weak person and acting weakly. And here, she is showing a weak acting. Her expression is stiff she looks half hearted. But I really hope she improve because rhis story has a good premise and seem like it could be a fun one The female lead character is just too boring, flat, and weak. Even until ep. 8 she still looks like that. Also, her face expression is very stitch, even when I watched her in the interview event, she act just like that. She reminds me of Shin Se Kyung\\'s flat expression. I wonder why this received a very low ratings. Its nice and i love the lead actor and actress. Can someone tell me the name of the girl playing the role of Taehee? The one who got engaged and Sang A\\'s friend. Thanks! I like acting go won hee ❤❤ I really like the acting of the main lead female. Im Dayoung\\'s character is more calm and pretty, different than the other female leads. I really enjoy Bona\\'s acting here, she\\'s really into the character. I hope the drama will give longer scene and more romantic side for Kim Ji Won and Im Dayoung. seriously the second lead female is better rather than the main lead. The story nice so far but the lead female should improve her acting. Hope the next eps she\\'ll do better. I really like the two main characters: the house helper and the untidy girl. But they are on screen only half the time! The remaining time, we see dozens of secondary characters, which were neverly properly introduced. I can\\'t even figure out who they are: some of them must be the untidy girl\\'s collegues, I suppose? I wish the drama focused on the main couple: the rest seems unrelated and uninteresting to me. cant believe im watchin this @ 2AM i thought it was gonna be like, same old kdramas but what we have here ,.. wouldnt say its amazing but it looks promising hope it gets better atw!! This drama sucks! Because the director is this drama is they same of Strongest Deliveryman.... I see many cast from strongest delevryman here hahaha @Chacha Many casts from strongest deliveryman here xD I’ve watched three shows with Ha Seok Jin where he literally plays the same character type, so I’m glad to see he’s playing a different type of character. Super excited!!! i like when korean drama explore various job in this world.. Bona fighting!! @kdramawatcher Bona is the female lead look at what written Bona\\'s nama before Go Won-Hee I just hope that Go Won Hee is the female lead. Ahhh can\\'t wait. Ha Seok Jin has a reliable oppa aura around him. I\\'m usually not big on age gaps but he\\'s 36 and she\\'s 23?? That\\'s a LOT So Bona is the female lead???? Wowwwwww.........her acting is too good for a rookie. so who is the female lead? I read from somewhere it\\'s Go Won Hee, and someone said it\\'s Bona? Jang nara please Ryu Hwa Young as female lead please >/\\\\< Jeon So Min unnie plsss!!!! Ryu Hwa Young as the female lead please...... Please offer Yoon Eun Hye or Han Hyo Joo or Song Ji Hyo to be the lead female..

       "  'comments': \"man satomi ishihara stole the show here. the plot is soap opera-ish, but the character development is surprisingly good. watching this drama is like watching a movie, it's psychologically intense though some scenes don't make sense. i had never liked satomi ishihara's acting but this drama made me think otherwise, i think she's excellent here. her chemistry with kazunobu is surprisingly endearing, i was rooting for them the whole time while watching. momo and pooh story is the main reason i keep watching. her sister's love story is not that interesting. @andyyy Ikebana IS a big deal This drama doesn't make sense. Plot is bad and unrealistic making a big deal out of a flower arrangement lmao perfect drama 10/10 @shinyaN so true. Plus Satomi's really pretty. I love Satomi's acting but the drama itself is a bit weird. I don't know how to explain. It's kinda disturbing at some scenes. But Satomi's So Pretty. Edgy. Kyoko yoshine, Satomi Ishihara and Yudai Chiba in one drama??? Alrighhttt!!! Bookmarked!???\",\n",

       "  'comments': \"This dorama really needs a sequel or SP!! im curious as to who's this Hayama Hibiki kid as well as the soprano boy (in i-dont-remember which episode)? does anyone know his real name? i mean he's too way cute and handsome!!!! Kento did great on this drama. His really turning into a very diverse actor. Am I the only one who noticed that in this drama seem like they make kento's brother love him so much. (Not compare to the Kdrama, if you have watched it already) though they did not add the bunny part because I think his brother dying and protecting him as his very last breath is convincing enough. Japan are really the best to this kind of drama. Additional to the best medical movies like Doctor X and Code Blue. Clap, clap! At first I was afraid that this remake is gonna failed like signal (japan) since the korean version was really good. But after watch it, I really love it. They successfully make their own version. Less drama and more emotional. I love the casts and their acting. They also deliver the storyline beautifully. i dont care if its a remake, because for me this drama is just PERFECT! not romantic too much, amazing cast, amazing stories and MORALS! veryyyyyyyyy emotional yesss! i cry in all episodes, hope it won't be short:' (:'(:'( Thank you to make this series not to be so much drama and romantic. Thanks to make it more into medical things and goodhearted stories. AKARI's comment was well written, I'm not sure what else to add. Well, to be frank... I just LOVE this adaptation. It's ridiculous how anyone would say that anyone in this drama had performed badly. And as far as adaptations of Good Doctor goes, this jdrama did pretty well to the spirit of the original. Much better than the US adaptation which I still felt that it's lacking the spirit of what made Park Sion/Shindo Minato's character an endearing one. Well-said AKARI san. AKARI san Congratulation Good Doctor for two digits rating for FujiTV 木10 in 4 consecutive weeks for the first time in 4 years!!!. One of the best asian series this year so far. Full of emotion with solid story plot. Actors are great especially Kento Yamazaki. I will definitely finish this series. Highly recommended.:) As i thought everyone is raving about his 'acting, am I the only one who is not impressed with Kento's acting in this, I thought the first episode was not his best but convincing enough but he lost me in second, I thought he would get better with each episode turned out he just lost control and started overdoing it. I watch first ep and Kento really did a good job! I thought Asami Mizukawa as michi togo I cried a f***ing lot while watching the first ep. I don't understand why most Japanese dramas are awful. Japanese movies are one of the best in the world. It's frustrating. 8 to 10 episodes is normal but unrealistic. I feel like watching a compressed version of the Korean one. Kento is finally testing his limits. After watching kiss that kills, I thought he really had improved so I was quite surprised after seeing this drama in dramanice today. I had to check to see if the lead I'm seeing on the poster is really my Kento. And wah! It really is him. He's working real hard to move away from his school boy roles. This is a remake of Korean drama right? I watch that korean drama's 1st episode but it felt different from this version. Kento cast in LA: he always choose same role. OMG, no one in Japan get tired with him already? I mean he's good actor indeed, but doesn't mean there are no young good male actor anymore in Japan right? For For two seasons (Winter and Spring), and then Summer, he appeared on several dramas. I think he got several roles on movie as well. Can't wait to watch this, another two days to go. I really love Yamazaki Kento and Ueno Juri Chill people it's not like Kento is powerful enough to demand these @Landon.K No one is saying Kento is not a good actor. It's just that he always get the best drama or movies, especially the adaption from famous manga and animes. They should have given other actor a chance. His fans love him, sure. But we need to see new faces other than him for once. @Yasushi agree @Jalibiebrr Suki na Hito ga Iru Koto is definitely NOT the best drama out there. There are tonnes of other drama that are better in terms of plot as well as actors. Give justice to this drama please. I love Joo Won and their original version. Frederick Highmore was really good as well w/ the US version though their attack with the drama was quite different since they have different audiences in the US. Looking forward to see this drama sson.:) Juri Ueno’s finally back! Can’t wait for this. Dude, the cast are lit!!! And if YamaKen doesn't deserve to be one of the cast members, you might want to his other drama. He's definitely not just for movies and adaptations. Seems promising, can't wait for ueno juri and fujiki naohito. He isn't everywhere!! And for ppl saying so move on!! Oh no! They should have give the lead role to Mackenyu Arata or Ryoma Takeuchi which are more good actors than Kento. People kept saying he's everywhere so i thought he was but nah, the list of dramas and movies aren't that long though? I know Kento is a good actor... but I'm kinda sick of seeing him everywhere. Give some other actors a chance for god sake. How come he gets every role? Ueno Juri is back! juri ueno? i'm in! Can't wait to see the chemistry of these 3 actors!! Couldn't be more satisfied with the casting ❤️ Is ueno juri the female lead?? Ueno Juri is starring in this one too. Can't wait to watch it!!!!✨ Korean version of the Good Doctor was the best so far! USA version was mediocre, no where close to the Korean version! So excited to see you in this drama, Kento kun. I know you can do it senpai. I dont think he can do it. Joowon played the character so well, it makes me cant believe yamaken can do the same. But well... I am still gonna watch it. Woaaahhhhhh........ Remake #loveeyes Finally getting a different role other than the high school stuff! Lol as much as I like him he's had the same role in most of his dramas and movies! This shall be a stark difference and I hope he can pull it off as I loved the Korean version This will be a challenging role. If he pulls this off, I'll admit he is a good actor. kentooooooooo love you so much so excited <333333 fighting yesssss feeling so excited i love you so much kentoooooo <3 fighting fighting fighting <3 love from mongolia kiss2 Ok I'm definitely watching this I've seen him everywhere nowadays but i ain't complaining lol. At first i thought he's just a pretty face but after watching some of his movies/dramas, he really can act with different character. Hope he does justice with this character too. YAY! Can`t wait to watch his new Jdorama, looking forward. Ganbatte Yamaken.\",\n",

       "  'comments': \"JP, SAAME! Plus why get the 2nd actress when she's 14 years older than Lee Shi A and has such a different body type?? Lately, I have second lead syndrome for evil characters. Worth watching! You can't stop once you started it! Haha, but... At the end, i just want eun han be with her husband, sorry!? The drama is good, but I keep wondering why they didn't cast two actresses with the same body type. Their body types are very different. It doesn't seem like it would have been that difficult. This drama was mind-blowing and had so many plot twists. Definitely recommend watching this drama! The ending was very satisfying. Warning though, you'll get hooked the moment you start on this drama, finished it in 1.5 days! The mansion looks very familiar. Anyone who watched Yong-Pal (Gang Doctor) will recognizance the interior and the front entrance. A few of the actors were also in both series as well. At the beginning i was annoyed by the amnesia plot. Korean writers seem to love it. After watching the entire drama, I'd rate it 8/10. I have to say i couldnt predict the storyline. I love that i didnt expect the story to unfold the way it did. The actors were also great. It was well casted. It was worth watching I love korean dramas but the amnesia plot is getting redundant. Too many dramas are using this plot and its so frustrating. Eun Han has lost her memory but then instinct has her doing things for her husband. But then can't even feel anything towards her mum when she first meets her. Argh. And how is a plastic surgeon with a private practice living in a studio and behind on rent. That's unrealistic. Omg this drama was so good. Loved the ending . Love AFAINA. I thought it was boring to watch BUT I was wrong because I LOVE IT MORE every episode. There's a twist in every episode and you will think what happened in that missing piece. Because of so many twist that caught my attention, I finished watching this drama in almost 1 and a half days only. This was a wonderful drama, finished it in one sitting. The cast did an amazing job and the storyline was very different from other Chaebol dramas. Yayy.. Jo Hyun Jae and Nam Sang Mi got nominated as excellence actor & actress at APAN award this year for their acting in this drama. Well, honestly, Jo Hyun Jae is more deserve to be called as true male lead rather than Kim Jae Won. This was the best drama in 2018. It showed women marrying into rich family without thinking about the consequences. Finally the drama comes to an end. Absolutely love its ending!!! Have been a while since there has been a satisfying end. @goldfish because after eun han cut her wrist, she saw Dara unconscious (Dara saw her father beated her mother) one thing that i didnt really catch up. Did jee eun han really tried to kill herself with the knife last time or someone did it in the basement? coz i really confused if she cut herself then why is she screaming for help and fall down in front of her psycho husband? Oh really public holiday chuseok @Xoulz Thank you Reading the plot, made me laugh. I hope the drama is good. I like the cast! There is public holiday (Chuseok) from 23/9 to 26/9. EPs is postpone to 29/9 It is really worth watching but im really disappointed because because they keep on delaying the airing.1 week is too long for me to wait already and now it became 2 weeks ooohhh gosh Omg it’s over finally. Why are they delaying this show?it’s supposed to air every Saturday does anything know the reason why? I am interested in watching this drama mainly because I am not familiar with the cast and because the plot seems so interesting to me. I hope I don't get too ahead of myself. But yeah if anyone can tell me if it's worth watching please let me know! I would appreciate it. Why the next (final) episodes will only be aired on 29 Sept?? Delay again.... Can't wait to watch the finale. Ok I like the two leads in the drama. I don't have high expectation about this drama because I don't really like drama about chaebol family that have so much grudge with people in the household. I watch this drama because Nam Sang Mi and Yang Jin Sung. But now I like this drama because every ep makes me curious what will happen next. Some chaebol drama don't have good plot that will make me confused and bored . But this drama pretty good and all actors are good too. this drama has been so good so far. Every episode is mysterious and it doesnt drag. The ratings shoudd be higher than what it is. sorry..but i ship eunhan with her husband..lol This is a great Drama I love it , and cant wait to watch new episodes I don’t get it! Is the butler a witch? The mother knew about her son, that’s why she didn’t want her son to be promoted. She said the higher he climbed the harder the falls. But I’m sure she didn’t know about SooJin. I think SooJin was the one who planted wrong picture about the wife thus triggered the bad reaction from the husband n mil, because she wants to be the wife. I'm curious what's in the phone? Maybe videos of abused or video the husband cheating with soo jin? I can't wait until the mother knows the real character his precious son is..urgh... I never know that this drama could be really good! Every episodes always make me curious what will be in the next episode. The story line was so interesting! I really like it! Every episode is really good. I'm curious about the next episode. This drama is very good. I can't wait to watch episode 15 (28-29) Good drama About the cellphone.. Maybe it recorded serious criminal at the garden? Looks like jung makes her husband into villain @JAC Now confused about who’s the boy father? Confused about the little girl? I still think that the woman before the surgery should have played as the one after the surgery. I don't think the current one playing the efter surgery woman is not fit for the role. (Just my opinions) Just viewed eps 10 and I agree with you she, the lead actress could bring some commonsense to the character. This is literally one of the worst shows I've ever seen. All the evil characters do whatever they want in plain sight and the main character is too stupid to know. It's frustrating as a viewer. Amnesia should not cause you to lose your common sense. The house it seems in I am not a Robot She stole the anchor's cellphone and was fleeing from thugs who were paid to kill her so I presume the anchor not only is her husband but also has some hidden sin and is the real villain. Why do I hope she'll get back together with her husband?wahhh!!! I am watching these drama because of KIM JAE WON he is a brilliant actor with a most pretty smile in the world Its a eye candy to see him on screen? I think the house is seem like the heirs's house I agree with some viewers, i dont understand why her personally change into a complete different after the plastic surgery? Doesn't seem to fit. And it seems she's not as cool or clever like before, and yes i found Nam Sang Mi replacement as a bit let down, Lee Shi A was a surprise to watch, i watched her previous daily and she wasn't good, but she was spot on in this role, she caught my interest. I am watching this Kdrama because of Jo Hyun Jae. Yet, I appreciate everyone's acting. the moment that warm watter issue was brought up it is obvious she is his wife. I start ship Kang Chanki and Nam Sangmi LOL still don't know what happen with their relationship and full stories about their life, but ... okay, Jo Hyunjae so hot. second lead syndrome maybe HAHA Ep. 8 reviled that Ji Eun-Han before the surgery is Kang Chan-Ki wife so that's how she know private things about him like even though she lost her memory after the surgery:O or thus wife is hidden in the basement because .. nah also too easy lee shi a is the wife of kang chan ki ... she has run away coz of no idea wot ... which is why he is looking for her ... nah ... too easy for a plot at first, Lee Shi A (Ji Eun Han before surgery) meet Dr. Han Kangwoo with all her problem and full of darkness. I love the actors in this film, but the story is too bad. It does not make sense. there are procedures that must be taken before ANYONE can perform a medical surgery. How in the heck does the guy just operate on an unknown person (no name, no emergency contact, no ID), that's ridiculous and too far-fetched. Watched 1 and 2 and like it so far, appreciated the production for given those supporting actors chance to be seen again. WOW this is drama is terrible already. What was the budget? It's so cringy and full of tropes and horribly shot I actually want to stab my eyes. yeayy finally the teaser is coming out, the teaser 3 is so adorable i like Nam Sang Mi & Kim Jae Won i'll ship them very strong <3 hahahah loveee!!! can't waitt This is a copycat of birth of a beauty. What to u think? How does it feel when Nam Sang Min meet Lee Sang Yoon in the same drama? I wonder?? Wow yeah finally NAM SANG MI & KIM JAE WON TOGETHER love them all , the cast, the plot the teaset and many more!! This drama going to viral I hope love then all!! Thank u PD nim you make my dream come true with the cast and the plot is so fresh ❤❤❤❤ CAN'T WAIT! the trailer is going out now, please keep update for the teaser this drama pleasee admin, i can't waittttttttttt!!! the trailer is going out now, please keep update for the teaser this drama pleasee admin, i can't waittttttttttt OMG nam sang ming & kim jae won love they're both so much!!!

Yuki such a good friend , esp when she clap hands after their performance . Haha @Tunjung Sasongko xxxJunkJAVmanZ yeah. I really like waterboys. This is waterboys all over again apart from it's girls @sang heuk: First episode is pretty okay and I like the vibe, reminds me a lot of the movie version. Anna looks like Brooke Fraser (New Zealand singer) here lol Ishii Anna!!! <3 @nannie: Tao is a talented actress and her dancing is good too. It has been a while since we last saw her in a drama so I'm really looking forward to this. I hope the other girls can dance too:). Can’t wait to see Anna >< I'm glad Tao gets to showcase her skills in dancing The story kinda reminds me of 'Dance Drill' with Eikura Nana though. I hope it's just as good. Looks like she gained some weight!! I love her....cant wait to see her..... Tao overacts in her acting sometimes. Still a fan of hers though. From the synopsis, I think it's a different story from Let's Go Jets. I hope there could be also a remake for past jdramas not a remake for jdramas that are recently aired:/\",\n",

       "  'comments': 'I am deeply in love with Yoon Doo Joon, he is extremely handsome and charismatic! I love all the 3 seasons, but this one is my most favorite. Very good plot, good and beautiful actors. I felt in love with Baek Jin Hee, she is so simple and has effortless true beauty. She really doesn\\'t need any makeup to prove that she is beautiful. So pity that this season was shortened to 14 episodes. I keep rewatching it. I hope there will be season 4 with the same main cast or another drama where Yoon Doo Joon and Baek Jin Hee can reunite. Love their chemistry! Dae Jang-Geum is Watching is more worthy of being called Let\\'s Eat 3. This was such a disappointing food drama compared to the past two. Lets eat season 3 are the best, ther are friendship romance career and family in this story, i almost didnt watch this drama, because i hate season 2. IT\\'S A GREAT DRAMA, BUT THE ENDING THOOO. really wish the best for jiwoo & daeyoung:( they are supposed to liked each other in the past. their college\\'s memories was so great, cute, nice, & so sweet:( really anticipate for the next season, Let\\'s Eat 4! please make Let\\'s Eat 4 come true! Daeyong never changes, really love his character. Am a Yoon Doo Joon fan. Have watched all the Let’s eat dramas and absolutely thought he was delightful in Radio Romance. He was so good. I’ll miss him while he’s fulfilling his service time. Love this series. Just as Ji Woon, I will waiting for Lets Eat 4. I want a happy ending for Dae Young\\'s career and romance. Make a reunion with his collage\\'s friend too, please. Let’s eat 3 is the best of 3 serie . This almost to perfect but it’s so short. All FC are feel sad about this. Gotta ask though was Soo ji and Dae young married? or engaged? they did have matching rings or maybe just a couple ring? I love Koo Dae Young so much! Watched the 3 series and love them all! Too bad season 3 have to be ended like this! Worst ending ever I hated that i even tried to watch this. I loved S2 and i tries this thinking that its like a spin off of some sort or a whole diff ver with same male lead but diff fem char i disnt know it would be connected with S2 and that they will kill Soo ji. Now S2 is also ruined for me knowing now that they didnt really have a hapoy ensing after all and the guy moved on from her so easily. Aaarrggghhh shouldnt have watched this at all!! They need to bring back the Let\\'s Eat Rap from Season 1. I followed all 3 series because of Yoon Doo-Joon. Part 3 had a great story simply because it gave us a glimpse of how Dae-Young became a food lover and food blogger. I was kind of disappointed with the ending though... it was very abrupt. It was sudden. I guess the production had to hurry the story for Doo-Joon\\'s military enlistment. But overall, it was still daebak! ♡ Loved this drama but was very disappointed with the ending. Seriously hoping they have a season 4 but keep Baek Jin Hee as the female lead. There is still so much story they could tell us with these characters. Hello from the other side of the world. I love watching this series. they do a very good job. Greetings from Turkey SPOILERS Watch them do Season 4 in 2 years with a new female lead and close off this story with something stupid in the first episode. I hope there will be season 4 with these casts. This season could be perfect if we can get another 2-4 eps. The story on the flashback is still inconclusive in my opinion. I think the story in the past still could be developed for s4 because some characters are still missing in the present story. It would be nice to see some interaction between byung ho and sun woo. S4 can also take advantage of doojoon\\'s new job because they ended this so early. What a weird ending. But he must do his duty to country. Interesting how the show focused on his character serving a bit. Is it odd to put it off so long? I hope the other actors and crew don’t lose income over the reduction. So i guess we will see Ji Woo and Seo Yeon in s4 right? Kinda disappointed with the ending. Was anticipating how Jiwoo and Daeyoung will end up happily ever after, his new company going successful. But happier for Seoyeon and Sun\\'s relationship, those two added the funny side of this drama. @ Thazin: The Song @ the End of Episode 14: Kassy - Same Memory As you know the drama has been shortened to 14 episodes due to the sudden enlistment of the main actor. It seems that no edit has been made to change the plot, because the ending of episode 14 suggest themes that probably would\\'ve been developed in the two missing episodes. However i loved Baek Jin-Hee\\'s performance, as usual. A praise even to Lee Joo-Woo, who had to portray a quite complex character. What is the name of ost song at ep 14 ending? Love season, but sad that it\\'ll only be 14 episodes. How many episodes left? Let\\'s eat 4 Please I like Let\\'s eat 1>3>2 i love season 1 >3 Nice drama keep it up? I\\'m sad because they will reduce the episode:( But I hope they will bring a good ending to this, and if they plan to make season 4, please just keep Dae young and Ji woo! don\\'t keep changing his girlfriend. If anything, please bring some of the cast from season 1. It will be fun! @jestine29 the thing is, current relationship between daeyoung and jiwoo is more interesting than their past. I keep curious when will jiwoo found out about daeyoung actually single, and how she will react to it? the flashback feel dragging to me. The only flashback scene that i like was when jiwoo\\'s mom appeared. Loving season 3!!! Way better than the first two seasons which I watched because season 3 made me curious. Apparently it wasn\\'t necessary. Baek Jin Hee has best chemistry with Dujun! The story also keeps me hooked. Can\\'t wait for the next episode. @Lol flashbacks are important as it showed us the long history of Ji Woo and Dae Young. I enjoyed it very much especially that they\\'re cute together. I agree this is eons better than Season 2! I just love the chemistry of the actors and actresses! Hope they are each other\\'s Happy Ending:) Both couples are adorable. I like Sun woo and lee seo yeon ( though they both childish ^^! ) and Dae young with Ji woo are good match. I love this season 3 more than 2nd season. i\\'m dissapointed they make \"flasback\" part lest interesting than the actual timeline part. Like i dont even care about their past at all, so it make me Skip every \"fashback\" scene and still catch up to whats going on in the actual timeline. I feel sorry for lee ji woo I think season 3 is much better than season 2. The chemistry between cast is more believable, especially since Goo dae young and Lee ji woo are an old friend. The storyline is also better, not all over the place like season 2. The food scenes is also look more delicious, I like the way Lee ji woo eats, she\\'s a girl but not shy when eating. So far so good. I like it much than season 2. The characters are not all over the place, and more likeable. Lee Ji Woo\\'s personality somehow match Goo Dae Yoong very well, she\\'s tough but also look fragile at the same time. Yeokshiii goo dae young is cool and my ideal type. I think dujun personality is the same with goodaeyoung. How dujun speak in variety show is just like goodaeyoung speak hahhahahah... My favorite female lead is Lee seo kyung from season 1. The character in season 1 is also very loveable. Season 2 is my least favorite. But i\\'m watching season 3 now, hopefully they make it better than season 2. I can\\'t believe Soo Ji died wuwu TnT Baek jin hee...love her acting..and the chemistry of the lead stars are so good..no need for.me to watch the first two seasons ..im hooked right now...with the third seasons.. All I can say, is that Goo Dae Yeong season 1 to season 2 end up as a relationship wrecker. Always the hindrance to the 2nd lead. But what I can say, its really a good drama especially season 2. My heart is crying upon reading the synopsis that they killed Beak Soo Ji. IKENNAT! I love the Goo Dae Yong get mature from season 1, season 2, and now season 3. i feel this drama combination with drama Replay... replay 2007? just my opinion but like this drama. Can we talk about the Lee Seo-Yeon & Sun Woo-Sun shipping plz? Shipping 2nd lead cast.. #seoyeonwoosun >< they are so cute I love story between sun woo sun and Lee seo yeon, i cant wait for thier story in lets set 3 I love sunwoo sun and lee so yeon  This season is the best really Lee Joo-woo is good at acting. Her character, Lee Seo-yeon is so unlikable (until eps 4). Sometimes I want to kick her out. Ok...We think of director perspective. If we still keep the heroine from s2 how the s3 want to story to us? Its nothing, maybe you have a bored love romance drama usually we watch. Yes i love chemistry from s2. But, still s3 chemistry also acceptable. Dont judge it to early, its just a beginning. Let\\'s watch it and forget about the past. I think Let\\'s Eat 3 is the best from all the season!!!! In Korea the agent and the broadcast company and the lawyers are all the same company. So if an actor goes to another network it’s hard for them to reprise a role if the series continues. Still closure people. Some backstory. I only finished 1 so I got some spoilers. It’s okay. Excited to see S1people. During S2 when the funny co-workers from the S1\\'s female lead\\'s workplace appeared for brief cameos the middle-aged man almost spitted out the reason why Dae Young and the S1\\' female lead broken up and then it got interrupted before the revelation happened. For S3 we got Lee Joo Seung\\'s character asking Dae Young about since when he\\'d been doing the over-the-top food preaching and it got cut off. Let\\'s Eat\\'s writer sure does have a way to play with the audiences\\' curiousity, isn\\'t she? lol but i do hope we\\'d get the answer for this season tho huhu. Loving the first 2 eps so far. Can\\'t wait for how the story would progress While some of you are upset over the fact that Baek Soo Ji\\'s character was \"killed\" in a turnout of a bus accident, i on the other hand a little dissapointed over the fact that the female lead for this season is once again a long-time-no-see girl friend of Dae Young. It somehow didn\\'t entice me that much. I remembered how intrigued i was upon watching S1 to see how characters of very different personalities would be in love together and when it started i couldnt help but to scream my heart out. S2 was not as exciting but it did has its overwhelming charm except for the love triangle thing but this one? I dont know. Each of them has their own issues and seem to be healing each other\\'s heartaches later in the episodes. Kinda promising but doesnt hype me that much but i\\'m staying till the end of course huhu @felldowntherabbithole As a fan of the Let\\'s Eat franchise, I think it\\'s insensitive for the writer to...I don\\'t know how to put it without giving out spoilers. Let\\'s just say, for the sake of introducing another woman in the show that they have to do that to Baek Soo-Ji is stupid. Although I like Soo-Kyung from season 1, I don\\'t think she is the right match for him. After all, she only liked him after discovering that he is the food blogger that she looks up to. Baek Soo-Ji is in every way Dae-Young\\'s match. They were friends first, they had their share of squabbles, they knew each other at their worst, and they fell in love at the same time. If a love story can happen in reality it would be theirs. I know that a lot of people don\\'t like season 2, but the love story between the leads were the most realistic. There is no hero worship, no holding on for \"what might have been or could have been\" just like what we\\'re getting now in season 3, no characters needed to be save, Baek Soo-ji and Dae-young were equals, and that\\'s why for me she is the only woman for him, regardless of the sudden turnout and the new character in the show. And this Ji-Woo doesn\\'t even have that gusto when it comes to eating. Unlike the prevous female leads they were so fun to watch whenever they eat that they make you want to eat, too. I know it\\'s too early but I would pretend that this chapter never happened and I\\'m only sticking out because of the food. [Spoiler] Spoiler+× @naomi Only ep 1 of season 3 has came out.... Don\\'t jump to coclusion,it\\'s just a beginning of episodes only. i prefer season 2 better than season 3 Ep 1 is so bomb??? the cliff hanger is so interesting???? can\\'t wait daeyoung;s love story pt.3 yeeaaah!!! It should be BYUNGHUN, the one that act as Kim Jinseok (2004) Yay! Been waiting for this for years...finally I\\'m so excited already!??? Im just here for Lee Joo-Woo, I loved soo-ah. So... Koo Dae-Young broke up again? New season, new girlfriend. AGAIN. Liked Season 1 and loved Season 2. I really love the concept of the serie and the main character Koo Dae-Young. I wish they also bring back cast from season 1, it\\'s my favorite. Hopefully season 3 is better than season 2. I hope Le joo woo and Ahn woo yeon have a love story here *.* i ship jin hee with doojoon so perfect 3 diferent girl friend LOL 3 dramas, 3 different lead females, Yoon Do Joon still the best mukbang actor LOL. hope Banzz will make a cameo appearance.... hwaiting!!! Baek Soo-Ji cameo? Oh, i think lovestory of Soo-Ji with Dae-Young will broken in episode 1, open new story for Dae-Young. Let\\'s eat 4 are coming... Im so excited because byeonghun will be in this drama. This is his second drama and I cant wait to see more of him in the future Waa i can\\'t wait for this drama, i know i\\'m gonna suffer drooling over the food but i really liked Let\\'s Eat 1/2 and i\\'m a big fan of Yoon Doo Joon, i don\\'t know much about Baek Jin Hee but her acting in Jugglers was fine so i guess she\\'ll do well in this one too. I need it, now I enjoyed Let\\'s Eat. They did a great job showcasing food and at the same time show a story plot. That was one of my favorite dramas so when I heard about Let\\'s Eat 2, I was excited about it coming out. However, Let\\'s Eat 2 didn\\'t appeal to me at all. The lines for the female lead were very annoying and that made me dropped Let\\'s Eat 2. I didn\\'t even bother finishing it. I cant wait!! Im really excited Seriously can\\'t wait for this one? New woman? Between Let\\'s eat 1 and 2, i think characters in Let\\'s eat 1 is the best. They are unique, good chemistry, and the plot is simple but i feel connected. If only they bring the characters in Let\\'s Eat 1 back. If there are going to be another love line between go dae young and the main female character, we should give this drama another name: Go Dae Young\\'s Love LIfe Great newss! Love booth of them! Dae-Young is the best character for Doo-Joon. I really really really can’t wait???? Will Go Dae Young fall in love all over again? not a good idea! Cant wait for this... ❤❤❤ Still haven\\'t moved on from radio romance but goo dae young image is totally different from Ji suho in radio romance so I\\'m actually waiting for it! I\\'m happy for ydj got the role again, but it\\'s just hard for fans from let\\'s eat 1 or 2 to move on with another girl again here. Hmm, and it\\'s goo dae young again. He\\'s really the most playboy character in kdramas seriously. But I know I\\'ll still love him though.>< all the cast and staff fighting!! I hope it will be another hit! Oh My God!!! yes...jin hee and doo joon...i wait this drama... doo joon is the best!!! YDJ plays better role in Let\\'s Eat than Radio Romance. i hope hwang seung eon still there.. Please don\\'t make Goo daeyoung brrak up from the female lead in Let\\'s eat 2 and have a loveline with Lee Jiwoo so it will make Goo daeyoung image as a Playboy and Please don\\'t make any kiss scene since I don\\'t want our dudu to kiss alots LMAO why must yoon doo jon again. why not another actor... Why. I love dae young soo ji couple huhuhuhu why cast same male if not same female. Pls dont destroy the happy ending in the lets eat season 2 I cant wait to watch this soon!! ❤️ From Singapore?? fans Please pick it baek jin hee unnie. Really love your acting in Missing Nine I haven\\'t watch season 1 or 2, but they\\'re really treating the main female cast as a tool for romance. 4th season should be guy x guy. yeeeeeesssssssssss looks love you in radio romance please pick please unni love you in jugglers please pick pick fighting Yey,,,,,,syiksyanimmmmmm...... oppa is doing radio romance is this real how will this fliming work and it is first half of 2018',\n",

Great cast, script, and especially..original soundtrack! Overall rating 5/5. great ost! One of the best drama I ever watched. This is a brilliant drama, it seems dark but very human. Kudos to the excellent writer, director, and actors. Thanks for the subber too!! when Takayuki Yamada a great actor of showa's era meet Suda Masaki a great actor of heisei's era, it gonna be a great drama.. saikoo!! ^^ I'm impressed with Suda's acting! I didn't pay much attention to him during GTO, and hated him in 35-sai no koukousei, but he was incredible in Teiichi no Kuni. The acting in this drama is so natural, I'm looking forward to watching every episode! Watching two decent actors play together in one drama is awesome. I watched already 2 episodes and I was impressed by the storyline and the acting! Summer 2018 will be enjoyable while waiting for this drama everyweek. It's been a while since I've watched a decent Japanese drama. The story will make you hook with a nice blend of action, suspense, and some funny moments. I'm really impressed how the actors played their roles. The acting is not exaggerated (i get annoyed on many jdramas because of this). Overall, if you're reading this and still haven't watch Dele, you're slow. Watch it! This drama is the best of summers 2018. This years summer drama kinda weak only this show is shines. Highly recommended After I had watched the first episode, I was impressed. I'm looking forward on this drama!\",\n",

They portray the characters according to the webtoon. So don’t overeact with their acting why Mirae is stiff and annoying because she is like that in the webtoon. Mirae dont have self confidence. And Im Soo Hyang acts like Mirae in the webtoon. That is why she got the role, cause they votes for her for the role. I have mixed feelings about the drama. First of all, I wanna list the things that I hated in it. Soo-Hyang\\'s acting was sooooo annoying. She acts shocked and surprised all the time. Always staring into space until someone talks to her. It just did not seem natural. I get that they want to give her this kind of \\'innocent appeal\\', but seeing her go like \\'huh?\\', and \\'yes?\\', every 2 seconds irked me. However, I did like Eun-woo\\'s acting as I could tell that he played his role perfectly-introverted and cold . I did like that they were promoting this idea of \\'looks don\\'t matter as much, but they advertised a weight loss drink, so that kind of was ironic in a way. I also would\\'ve liked it more if they cut off like extra unnecessary scenes with the bartender. They could have filled the scenes with like Soo-Ah\\'s past and how she came to be this way ..etc. Overall I would give it a 6/10 Such a nice drama! At first I didn’t think this would be that nice of a drama but from the first episode itself the drama exceeded my expectations! Highly Recommend everyone to watch it. It’s light hearted but really gives a message to the society on women’s appearance. The main leads are amazing and so cute? Loved it so much! Seriously one of the best k dramas I have ever watched! All the scenes and acting is best. I suggest more dramas of Im soo hyang and cha eun woo to be created?. Loved the drama and it\\'s funny too?. The story is iteresting,,the acting is not that great but not bad also,,i luv the drama as the story is more details,.. @kae I wish I had amnesia to rewatch this drama, so damn good! The scenario and dialoque so cute and fun to watched. The actress so cute and the actor ao handsome although he looks like a robot but still addictive watch him;) Cha Eun woo....you have a fan in me! You were awesome and kept the show going! Loved it! The drama in itself was meaningful with lots of small lessons and gives all of us a little something to think about. I also loved the cast and looks like all of your hard work paid off. Loved the webtoon but loved the drama better ( very few dramas that do that). So kudos to the cast and the directors and producers for bringing the whole thing to life. I think in the webtoon, Kyungsuk \\'s character also expressionless introvert .same with his character in drama.. .he is cool and capable person but distant and awkward person too because he has wound in his heart because of his broken family so he is hard to approachable.. If me.. I love Kyungsuk \\'s character here in this drama and the other characters too.. Maybe some people have different taste.. I watched this drama because I was so in love with the story in the webtoon. But turns out it was a great disappointment to watch the series. I understand that they have to make a longer story to match with the airing period or something, but there were so many useless characters play some useless scenes. I mean like they could have prolong the story with more essential things like the story about Kyungseok\\'s family, Sua\\'s past background, etc instead of the story of JungBoon and the bar owner or anything. Wooah. What a concept? loved watching this drama! Question: Does anyone know the name of the weight loss drink in the show? I know that it sponsored the series but I can\\'t read Hangul so I don\\'t know the name of it... i think all comment just for male lead chara so cool etc its so clasic, and so bad cool its not like that. and in this drama also have female lead chara. and i dont know with female lead character, not suitable with this theme, with story, with expression, with intonation. its so make unbalance drama from intro, climax, and conclution, clasic surprisse in this story also. for support chara so annoying, i dont know with your job in here. the first episodes were okay but the story took too long to develop especially for Mirae and Kyung Seok. It felt like there were in high school and trying to do puppy love dating. No real rivals or engaging scenes. I struggled to finish this drama and it wont be on my repeat list. I dont know.. I just dont like the female lead character.. Not the cast but the character, mirae was so naive .. do you know where is the location where they film the last scene? you know, the place that\\'s perfect for proposal. thanks I\\'ve read webtoon of this drama before watching this drama....Well..there is bit different between drama and webtoon in term of story line etc...although like that...I love both version....this drama become one of my favorite dramas in 2018..I love all cast\\'s portrayal in this drama especially Lim Soo Hyang, Cha EunWoo and JoWoori here... They nailed it.. BTW congratulation for Cha EunWoo and Jo Woori of your winning in Korea Drama Award 2018 because your portrayal in this drama especially Cha EunWoo...Hopefully I can see his acting again in upcoming project First..I have read webtoon version before watching the drama..well there is bit different between webtoon and drama in term storyline etc ..although like that..I love both version..love the all cast\\'s portrayal in here especially LimSoHyang, Chae Eun woo and Jo Woori..it is one of my favorite dramas in 2018..btw Congratulation for Cha Eun Woo and Jo Woori because of your winning in Korea Drama Award 2018 especially Cha Eun Woo...Hopefully I can see your acting again in upcoming project ♡♡ Ok i hate the series so much. I hate how do a very cool and reliable kyung suk turned into a timid dork introvert man. While in webtoon mirae couldnt believe someone as cool as kyung suk loves her, mirae in tv series think why she sould b in love with an uninteristing character like kyungsuk. Mirae, who her whole life is an ugly girl with low self esteem, thought kyungsuk weird..! I think it\\'s too short, it focuses more on the main lead story, I am curious with what happened to woo young, Hyun Jung and the parent story. They should have extended for another 2 episodes:( didn\\'t expect much when starting this drama but turns out it is really fun and light! they explored the issue of beauty standards in korea quite well, and the storyline isn\\'t over the top, really enjoying it so far! It well be nice if more ep.. because I really don\\'t want this drama end!!! Already Fall in love with the male lead. He really cute.. n the ending was good!! I really recommend you guys watching this drama.!!! i watch this because webtoon was so good and they are chemistry student like me hehe. curious how well this drama, and it is not bad. i love it~ Love the drama the actor are so good and talented love them all Kang mi- Rae she is good and looks lo Do kyung-seok love him:) Great Job to everyone Need season 2!! I started watching this drama for Eunwoo but I liked the lead actress more than him at the end. I remember many were against casting her in the beginning. she is so great but he was stiff in many scenes. I understand his character was supposed to be cold but in some scenes like those with his mother and the kiss scene his eyes were expressionless BUT he is a skilled idol and I\\'m sure he will be better in the future.((if he was a female idol I think he would have been bashed a lot by those who always criticize female idols for pursuing their acting career saying they should stick to singing and leave acting for actresses)). For the other characters, I really loved every single female character in the drama even Soo-A (her acting is so good) especially the chubby girl who rejected that guy in a very savage way. Because of the ending that left me hanging, last night, I was totally dreaming of it until episode 20... I thought it was real so I came here just to check, and yeah, only episode 16... @naira completely agree, I was a bit disappointed that they didn\\'t throw much light on soo ah\\'s tragic past and her grandma. Nonetheless it was a great drama. The story was a bit short it must be extended to 20 ep. They didnt emphasized much of Soo Ah\\'s life. The reason behind she\\'s treating bad her grandma. I hope have season 2.... I wish there will be season 2 pleeeeeeeease huhuhu Looove the chemistry between the leads, the tiny gestures dont even feel scripted. Kyung Seok is head over heels and it shows! Best romcom drama, even compared to the most popular ones recently. Hope to see Soo Hyang and Eun Woo in other projects soon! eunwoo did a very good job all the cast were all amazing i love it? one of the best drama i have ever watched. best romcom... i really really loved it Would like to have a season 2 of this one. @/Chloe it was \\'The Blue Night of Jeju Island\\' but Sungwoon changed the lyrics. Why it ended too soon? They should extend it A perfectly wrapped up beautiful youth drama not to be missed in 2018. Definitely and undoubtedly the best drama adapted from webtoon.the perfect casting and excellent awkward acting from both leads was worth a watch.another best part of the drama was its soundtrack .I checked out every another song that was used on the drama separately in YouTube and got hooked to them.the drama was wrapped in beautifully without any loopholes with each and every character getting their own ending..loved the drama..I won\\'t mind watching it again;) Does anyone know the song Sung Woon sung at the last episode when he teased Mi Rae and Kyung Suk that goes: let\\'s leave just the two of us, wearing same hoodies. I\\'ve already search using keyword in hangul also but still cannot find it. I think it\\'s either an old song or an indie song. Does anyone know the song Honestly, I love the webtoon @raghad: you can watch Birth of the Beauty, it has the same theme with this drama i cried everyday because i miss this drama so muvh I love it!!!! Can there be more drama like this?? <3 just watched the last ep i never write reviews and this my first time. i just wrote this to say that i needed this kind of drama at this time the plot about loving and accepting yourself is portryed very beautifuly and mirae and soah\\'s conversation in the last ep confirmed that, anyway very fresh and easy-going drama yet so many good lessons Great chemistry between the leads. Holding hands was never sexier. Love both of them. She is absolutely beautiful and played the part to perfection. This drama certainly has given me insight and compassion into the whole issue of plastic surgery. I never thought how traumatic it could be for the whole family. So Ah\\'s part certainly was a lesson in the recognition of manipulation. I love that for once the lead guy wasn\\'t swayed by it at all. Most of all what is so great about this drama is the refreshing and honest dialogue. I love this drama sooooo much. I also love how they play BTS music sometimes❤ please add more episodes? They kissed. I waited so long for you guys kissing scene, ep 15. I love you both (Mi-Rae & Kyung-Seok) I love this drama. However, how sad! Only 1 episode left. Please add more episodes. I’ll surely miss this drama. I love it so much ❤️ I need more episodes of this drama please extend the drama to 20 episodes Kang mi rae reminds me of Rosé from blackpink idk why even the voice is similar i hope im not the only one hehehe So i get that some people find it slow paced and boring but in my opinion i dont think its boring at all, its interesting to me.. and what intrigues me even more is the moral behind this drama.. looks arent everything, however double standards exist and people make judgements based on a person’s appearance. A book shouldnt be judged by its cover. This drama does justice to society’s attitudes towards our looks:) and the lead actors are great, at lease theyre both good at acting as awkward characters lol is it just me or Jung Hye-Rin looks like hyeri from girls day I just loved the drama. They all did such a grt job. Tho Cha eunwoo was too cold? bt it looked so cool?. Grt team ❤ Mirae and kyungsuk are so cute i will miss them Kyung seok and Kang mi rae why they are so cuteeee >< this drama needs to be extended come on 16 episodes are not enough:( You know i never understood why ugly people get criticised and unwanted for their looks and pretty people get praised and when ugly people want to change their looks and become pretty they get bullied for having a low self esteem and for trying to change themselves when their the same people who bullied them into having a low self esteem. Is there season 2 of this show? Or after 16 episodes it\\'s the end? What mobile phone brand/unit they used here? ? This drama is so good! Ok Do kyungsuk and kang mirae chemistry is just... Zero i mean its awkward and stiff and people watch it bcs cha eun woo they dont mind kang mirae, i mean the story itself is good but kang mirae is so awkward to everyone, not only for do kyungsuk, however im gonna watch it till the end of the episode Mirae and kyungsuk look cute together>_< genuinely nice story, hope it will lead to a good lesson; how we should honor some one based on his/her good character/personality and inner beauty instead of fake or insincere as Soo Ah @Elena: It seems you only focus on the love story of Mirae and Kyung Suk. You don\\'t understand that Mirae has a problem as Gangnam Beauty. Last episode is the climax of the story. let\\'s wait for the anti-climax of the story. this will be a beautiful ending @Elena it’s not as simple as that. As someone who grew up with very very low self esteem, I can very much relate to Mi Rae. Ignoring what other people say is difficult when a lot of people judge and say harsh things to you. I wish I can say that I can just forget those words but they would usually creep up and eat you without any warning. No matter how much you try to love yourself, it’s difficult when people around you say other wise. Sometimes when I feel good at myself, I am reminded of other people’s words and would crumble down again. Even up to the point of thinking I cannot be loved haha I don’t even want to have crushes on handsome people because I know it will never come true. Just saying that I can understand how Mi rae feels. I love this drama but I have the feeling they will rush a lot of things in the last episode. I\\'m starting to get so upset why what others think are so important. they don\\'t pay you bills why mirae cares so much. Just ignore them and be happy:\\\\ I was hoping they will together by now I can\\'t wait to watch episode 13 14 15 16 ...?? i love this drama so much i can see myself to kang mi rae in her bullying story? but it can be done by that coz until now i\\'m still get bullying in school but i don\\'t give up at all coz i want to conquer my Goals in my life for my family? cha eun woo is very handsome woah his visuals are out of this world Can\\'t wait for happy ending.. Hope for season 2.. Love from Indonesia.. mirae went through a lot of bullying and got humiliated so much in her life i don\\'t blame her for trying to stay away from handsome guys she feels unworthy of love which is very sad and she is afraid that people will make fun of her for dating a pretty man while she is being called a gangnam beauty! Mirae makes me cry a lot i hope she will overcome her insecurities and be with kyungsuk he knows her face before and after surgery he truly loves her for who she is <3 so i’m annoyed about the latest episode. why can’t we see any change in mirae personality she has powered through all these awful things that have happened to her and she is still the same naive girl from the first episode. she knows the kyung-seok but she continues to break his heart with the same excuse she always uses OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THEIR RELATIONSHIP! it’s just makes me sad that we won’t get to see a lot of them being a couple because she has not evolved as a character. in the webtoon you can see her mature as she becomes aware of herself but not in the show. on a positive note the main actors do an amazing job at portraying these characters! Episode 12 is Daebaaakkkkk!!! this is such a nice drama it is doing justice to the weebtoon <3 i love this drama it\\'s been a while since i watched a drama this realistic and relatable. I feel for Mirae a lot and kyung Suk is so adorable i\\'m in love... Really love this drama... I agree the story is so slow and boring that Im thinking already if its worth the time watching BUT because I like Cha Eun Woo of Astro I will watch it til the end stiff and boring plus the soundtrack makes the story too serious that u can\\'t even smile a bit but i still love this drama actually it gaves me the feeling of sympathy, forgiveness, love. Cha eun woo acted so good. Must watch Drama. I think the webtoon is much better If u read the webtoon then u will know why they act like that because thats how there character were in the web toon:) This drama is so boring. Drop it after 5th episode. can\\'t wait for the next episodes. I think that’s how they’re supposed to act.. you can try reading the webtoon to see how they are.. Is it just me or are the leads\\' acting too stiff? I get that Mi-Rae is still shy and Kyung-Seok has some family issues, but their scenes are hard to watch. This drama without soo ah would be so boring. I hate her character the same time as I like her character. I love this drama so far...not only that the characters are lovable, the story tells us about how we judge people according to face is useless. Most of us think that people who do plastic surgeries are not good people, and that is a wrong thing to do, this drama tells us that as well. Just like how Hyun Soo Ah seems to be a natural beauty but she is evil, that tells that even how went think naturally pretty people are always kind, is also a wrong thinking. I love how this drama is portraying the fact that judging people according to looks is evil. And I love Cha Eunwoo and Lim Soo Hyang so much, they look so great together! Can\\'t wait for the next episodes ^^ Cha eun wooo?????? Everytime i want to slap Soo Ah, i realised that without her character, this drama wont be as interesting as it is. I’m nervous everytime i see her as she always looks like she’s up to something hahaha.. This drama deserves so much love!!! So, can i say that the drama was a succeess?? They say, a drama is s success if viewer immersed with the charachter.. everyone\\'s talking about how this drama is showing the flaws in beauty standards the evils in society WHATEVER cha eunwoo is cute and caring as hell unlike other drama leads let\\'s focus on that this drama so best. . i like that. . i will give 10/10 for this drama. Cast are great and the storyline is quite interesting,one that doesn\\'t know what real beauty is naive,and kind, a first timer of almost everything, that they don\\'t know they both are falling for each other. One beauty thats manipulative that wants attention hiding behind the lies as it goes. Very interesting, can\\'t wait for the next episodes. Thank you for the writers, productions and the cast. Job well done. This is a must watch drama. I feel like it related to me as i have met \\'Soo Ah\\' in real life, pretending to be the nicest person on earth but they are stabbing you. \\'don\\' t judge a book by its cover\\' but so many people judge being ugly is a crime. Hope this drama will be put into a great ending. very great original story (the author of webtoon is genius), very good looking cast, very amazing ost (many good song, ost part 1 from a two girls of weki meki is my favorite)... wonderful cinematography and drama script adaptation is nice This drama is a definite must-watch, I haven\\'t found a good drama that I thoroughly enjoyed in a while. I\\'m dying to know who is mi rae that in middle school student I’ve encountered a real life Soo-A. An angel in the outside, evil on the inside. Looks isn’t everything... Did I just see Bora on episode 5 cameo? I loved it more! @holy i\\'m with you, like wth of the problem she had a plastic surgery since there was hyun jung in herside, the problem when she turned out to be Mi Rae with a new face because she was depression of her life, she has no friend and always got bullied from everyone, in webtoon series jung boon and ye eun are really impactful for her life, and she got trick from soo-A, but it seems a bit off at the drama Give me one yeon wooyoung in real life? I hate Friends who pretend to be nice wen they are the worst, its better to show your true colors let every one know who u are. Naaaaaaah!! I really wish that Mi-rae and kyung Seok would be together as soon as possible huhu i\\'m really into with this drama series. I can\\'t wait for the remaining eps... One of the songs in the OST is very addictive to listen. I love this drama very much I can\\'t wait for the next episode. I dont think Oh Hyunjung role is really needed in the drama version. Bcs Kang Mirae was pictured as a teen that had no friend at all bcs almost everyone bullied her and the rest domt give a F. That\\'s why she was really into SooA\\'s fake kindness in the webtoon version cz she thinks that\\'s the feeling of having a \"friend\" Love it so far <3 Really like this drama, I already read the webtoon and I love it. The story was a little bit different from the webtoon but not changed the entire storyline. The actor and actress was portrayed the characters well, the antagonist also potrayed so well and make me hate hyun soo a in drama more than in webtoon. Overall I think this drama was worth to watch. Love this drama❤ This is one of the best dramas I\\'ve seen ever. I could relate to the main character a lot. Both her portrayal and background story are wonderfully realistic and harsh. How awkward she is and her worries are relatable and I enjoy the pacing of her development. The drama features many strong women who are victims to beauty standards but who can rise above that. It\\'s so clever to see the various ways that the antagonist manipulates people around her. The best thing about this drama is not once did I think \"Why did you do/not do that?\" There are almost no dumb, annoying time-consuming misunderstandings. All characters address their grievances and misunderstanding. There are no coincidental tropes or beating around the bush that so many Kdramas use to build conflict. Overall, I really support this drama. I would love to see how Eunwoo continues to grow as an actor and hope that he grows braver to insert more of his own interpretation of his character. Wow. This drama is on point with the harsh reality of today. I like it. Simple and yet full of substance. Love this drama. Reality trikes! How society have changed the definition of beauty. It\\'s because of the influence and publication of all channels of media - it somehow developed a so called \\'standard beauty\\' which basically dictates an acceptable measurement of physical appearance to be called beautiful. SO WRONG! In this drama, it also portrals the abuses of victims of such stigma, their stuggles and difficulties. the makers did an excellent job in making the drama out of the webtoon. if you read the webtoon first you will realize how accurately most of the important scenes from it have been shown. most of the casting is also perfect. this kind of a storyline makes you question all your beliefs about appearances. I would recommend this drama if you have strong opinions about this topic. It tackles harsh reality. Society has created a standard of physical beauty when it facts we are all beautiful. Discrimination is prevalent not only in Korea but every edge in our world. I also experienced discrimination, I felt depressed and out of place. That\\'s why I keep on developing my skills to prove that I belong here. Beauty is not measure physically rather it is indeed by attitude,skills and mind. Hope time will come that no one experience being bullied just because of physical appearance. So far, I really enjoy everything about this drama! The storyline and how they potrayed their character are worth to watch. At first, I doubted to watch this drama but after watching it well I think I was wrong! It\\'s quite enjoyable and the leads are really good in their respective portrayal. The idea of plastic surgery is so common in South Korea,yet it carries such a big stigma for those who had undergone these cosmetic procedures. Such is the irony of life and cruelty of human beings. If one is born with less than desirable features, one gets picked on, criticised & bullied. When one undergoes cosmetic procedures, one can still get picked on, criticised and stigmatised. What the hell?! Oh i love love this drama! I love the webtoon first tbh, At first i kinda afraid it won\\'t portrait the webtoon well but i was wrong! Im so hyang really looks like Mirae and she delivered the clumsiness so well, also Eunwoo, Kyungsuk is actually so stiff and a bit arogant in webtoon and Eunwoo also playing the character so well! Even Sua, webtoon or drama omg i hate the girl! Lol .. Remember that this drama came from webtoon adaptation, just read the webtoon if you wanna know. Few plots were not coming from webtoon like Mirae\\'s dad, Mirae\\'s roommate, but well because this is a drama i understand that some have to add for the sake of the show. As long as it\\'s not changing the plot it\\'s fine. The story has a connection to some viewers, some are not. Struggling or aiming a thing to make the most of you especially when you want to is not bad as long as you never hurt others. Well, the leading lady here does seem like has an intimidating attitude even her choice was undergone facial surgery. She should not. She supposed to show her talent and her brain. The leading actor is so handsome, not matched to a leading girl. But still, the leading lady is a little pretty. Wish the leading girl would stunt in the end and Cha Eu Woon would embrace her even the leading lady had changed her face. I rate this high, I like the story like this. Fighting!!! Love all the casts. I love this drama! Can\\'t wait for the next episode! ❤❤❤❤ who is the cute curly-haired student who wears glasses? he\\'s an extra, but he\\'s in a lot of scenes in the background so i thought he\\'d be mentioned on here but i don\\'t see him TT can anybody tell me his name? Soo-A is something else, I hate girls like that. Always pretending to be nice when they are not. Do kyung seok will never like her if that\\'s what she is after. Love Kwak dongyeon so much~ i really love the relationship between mirae and her dad. i always cry when their scene come up even if it\\'s only a second:\\'( Damn I LOVE this one! Light story with deep feeling hahah i don\\'t know how to express it right. It\\'s a kind of story that i\\'m looking for in a drama, like an easy listening song sort of? Very enjoy to watch and can\\'t get enough of. Definitely one of my faves. PS: looove the details of their life as college students, seems so real. Damn i miss the old good days! Why is she acting as if she is scared of soo A, she does everything soo A asks her to do. Untill when is she going to realise that soo A is jealous of her and is backstabbing her? The earlier she learns to stay away from her the better for her. She should loosen up and stop being insecure and learn to defend herself, she\\'s too timid and afraid and that\\'s why everybody is stepping on her. She shouldn\\'t be a fool till the end pls Hyun Soo-A is such a b*tch. Hahahahaha The expression of the lead male character is a little bit stiff. He needs more practice. He looks good but i want to see him.improve his acting talent In ep5 i am curious about the song @ when he pulled her back at crossing. If anyone knew about the song plz reply me I was skeptical on watching this drama at first because I thought it could be another \"so so\" love story, a typical damsel in distress saved by the knight and shining armor series but it has a catchy plot. It has a different level of twist that can be both inspiring and give you butterflies in the stomach.Cha Eunwoo is adorbaly handsome and Lim So Hyang is perfectly innocent and lovable. Hyun SooA is such a bitch haha. the story concept is so original, thumbs up to the webtoon writer... You summed up the drama\\'s concept so beautifully. Thanks. @Andre You are just the same with those friends who mock her because of her face. The ponzi analogy does not work at all (did she hurt anybody to get plastic surgery?). I also don\\'t think plastic surgery is the best solution but those who do plastic surgery is much better than those who mock others because of their appearance. I don\\'t really think you get the concept of this drama @Andre. Sometimes you can\\'t gain confidence just because you want to, the main character was bullied her entire life because of many different aspects about her body and face, even after losing tons of weight she was still bullied so she decided her last resort would be plastic surgery. Mirae(the main character) DOES go to a school where nobody knows her after her procedure yet she still gets judged by a lot of people because they think she is the typical Gangnam Beauty. I don\\'t know what if you know what a gangnam beauty is but it\\'s basically a really pretty person from gangnam that people stereotype because it is said that every pretty person from gangnam has the same sort of face because they go to similar plastic surgery clinics in gangnam. The term \"Gangnam Beauty\" is considered criticism and this drama is shedding light on the harsh life that people who undergo plastic surgery sometimes have to face. If you watch the drama then you would know the main girl is still very insecure about herself despite undergoing plastic surgery and she\\'s afraid that people think she\\'s either still \"ugly\", or that she\\'s a plastic surgery monster. The whole point of this drama is about finding confidence in yourself and learning about what the true meaning of beauty actually means regardless of what you look like, plastic surgery or not. Nice Story and good start at least, hope that it continues... Love this drama.I like the story about this drama.Everyone need to watch this drama @Ro, \"let me introduce her\" is more like birth of a beauty, this one seem different. Birth of a Beauty??!?!? This show is very interesting. Can\\'t wait for the next episode. This show bothers me on so many level. There\\'s something very wrong with a show about people doing tons of plastic surgery who now look gorgeous supposedly doing a show to teach about true inner beauty. That\\'s like a story about people who ponzi schemed others out of billions of dollars now teaching us about how hard work will yield true success and that happiness doesn\\'t come from money. Yet they are filthy rich now and don\\'t ever have to suffer another day regarding poverty again. If the main character goes to another school where no one knows her, she\\'d be the gorgeous newcomer and will be so after college due to her plastic surgeries. Watching the drama of the manga is so wonderful.I mean watching the alive versions of cartoon characters . This drama is one of my favourite dramas this year. Hope ratings will go high. I am obsessed with this drama! Love it!? Love this drama but someone know who is the actress that play the waitress in ep 4? What\\'s the song title in episode 2 when remembering school time? Highly recommended!! at first im only gonna watch this because of the male lead unrealistic face! as in damn hes so pretty, but i fell inlove with the plot! Also kudos to production for giving us such quality drama, hopefully they maintain it until it ends! Im so inlove with this drama Already loved it❤ I\\'m starting to love this drama omooo:> I think the plot is refreshing daebak Omagawd this drama is awsome I just watched episode 3 and I couldn\\'t stop fangirling over the love triangle (omg it happened twice in one episode I couldn\\'t believe my eyes such bait). I wish Kang Mirae had a stronger personality she seems very week and fragile. But so far this drama gets a solid 9/10 for the first 3 episodes. . .just wow. . .this is super daebak . . . .looking forward to more exciting episodes / . . . . Soo A is not even as beautiful as kang mi rae, I don\\'t know why everybody is just going crazy about her. She\\'s just jealous of mi rae, and I think she did plastic surgery too but she\\'s hiding it. I hate her. I think the teacher knows mi rae from the past, or is he just developing feelings for her? He\\'s soo cool This is Daebakk!! Ep1 already got me hooked and love every character, after dancing new face and the main actress talk to her mom in the phone made me cry hard (love that scene) and the acting!! Just love this, can\\'t wait for the next episodes!! FIGHTING <3 JUST LOVED IT... love this drama so appealing feeling to girls @She I really love drama from ep1 and can\\'t wait for next episodes I love it so much. The casts really look alike with the webtoon character, just i thought soo ah would have black hair like the webtoon because it\\'s her trademark somehow but overall it\\'s okay. I love how they added the relationship with mirae\\'s parents here. Kyungsyuk is so handsome and charismatic, really calm and emotionless just like the webtoon and he\\'s so handsome, i said it again. Lol. Their hairstyles are also really similar to the webtoon and i\\'m so happy about it. Ah, and also they act really great. I cried during yhe scene mirae ran to her father when her father disappointed in her. Love it so much. I can\\'t wait for the next episodes Just read most of the webtoon in English. So far it\\'s pretty close to to it. Seem to skip some of the stuff that is important. Hope do more back stories of the characters or it isn\\'t going make much sense. So far it\\'s looking good. They got cast close however then main actress and the secondary actress highs a little wrong since the main is suppose to be taller than her. Who is playing Do Kyung-Seok young character? I want to capture Cha EunWoo, he is just too beautiful for the world!! I loved the webtoon and just know i watched the live drama adaptation and Kang Mi Rae and DS are true characters emits from legendary young actors .I\\'m pationatly waiting for the next episode with lots of love from Egypt Loving it so far. Can anyone tell me the English song that played in episode 2 mark 1:16. I really fell for it I\\'m really liking it so far (even though it\\'s only two eps). But for those who are worrying about it being like the webtoon, so far it\\'s accurate and good. Can\\'t wait to watch next episode! So excited!! This is my kind of drama! And the people too.. the male lead charachter was so damn cool!! I really want Eun Woo to act well, but then again, he\\'s a newbie. Every time I want to criticize an idol because of their horrible acting skill, I try to remind myself that Siwan (I criticized him for poor acting in \"The Moon That Embraces The Sun\"), now a Cannes-nominated movie actor \"The Merciless\". So yeah, I\\'ll wait for Eun Woo to enhance his acting skill. But for now, I\\'m going to enjoy this drama till the end (a fan of the web-toon). I pray he\\'ll be better than the first two episodes... I\\'m not a fan of eunwoo, but give him a chance. His acting in other dramas are so good, considering he\\'s an idol. Even some actor/actress who major in acting couldn\\'t act as good as him. The character he\\'s playing here was supposed to be cool, a little bit distant and didn\\'t smile much. To suissant, I\\'m not defending any idols acting or eunwoo, but based on the webtoon the character was supposed to be like that. the webtoon itself already that good so I really waiting for this drama came out and then when I watch the first episode. I was like “wow I didn’t know that Lim Soo Hyang will be look like Kang Mi Rae in the webtoon, like exactly the same. Lim Soo Hyang is Kang Mi Rae in real life.” and i like the fact that they add another story into the drama like the conflict between mirae and her father, it was really sad for me. I already watched the second episode and can’t wait for the next episode?? OMG, I love this drama so far and can\\'t wait for the rest of the episodes. This drama has everything I love in a drama, even though it\\'s early I have to say this would have to be in my top 10 best kdramas. Love it. really loved the two first episodes, I\\'ll read the webtoon until the third episode come out because I don\\'t think I can wait? tried watching the first episode and I must say: the lead actor seriously need some time learning how to act. It has been a long time I\\'ve seen such bad acting. Nothing against idols debuting in dramas and there are some who were pretty goot at it, but this one seriously needs some time with an acting coach or something. there\\'s 16 episode they said in one of the knowing bros episode Seo Ji-Hye is from Heart signal season 01, Can\\'t wait for sure ~ just when will they make Kwak Dong-Yeon the lead actor? seriously additional info: Shin Junseop from boy group MYTEEN plays the role of the middle school Do Kyungsuk Actor are too much younger for actress? but I love both actress and actor? I’m so happy that they are all Aries. The leads that is...lols...looking forward to this. @specky203 i completely agree with your points, i have red the manhwa and she is a perfect fit! im amazed that she accepted the role of being a \"gangnam beauty\" shows that shes really a professional and great actress! @gureum, that\\'s the point why she was casted because they want to show how \"old\" she looks for her age... Kwak Dong-Yeon! Cha Eunwoo fighting! You\\'ll do amazing, hyung! Can\\'t wait to see you! i had seen the teasers and i so excited for the manly and cold look of our gorgeous smiley eunwoo ♡ Mew@ Im Soo Hyang really fits with Kang Mi Rae character. Quite dissapointed with the cast T.T What if he changed his hair to silver or black silver? maybe it would be similar But the lead girl looks like Eun-woo\\'s mother or older sister in the drama .. @el it looks like you haven\\'t read the webtoon yet. The meaning of gangnam beauty is someone who do plastic surgery in many areas of her body that makes her apearance simillar to many girls in gangnam area. I am rooting for Cha eunwoo! Cha eunwoo oppa fighting! I hope this drama gets good rating. Jo Woo Ri is so pretty, I hope she got a main role for her next drama ❤️❤️❤️ Hwaiting unni @amaya Obviously because ... no one thinks it\\'s important. This isn\\'t the first time there is a 5-10 years age gap between the leads of a drama. As long as both are adults , which is the case here, I don\\'t think a lot of people will think that it matters. sounds interesting but why is no one talking about the age gap between the two leads. Everyone, you need to watch KBS The Best Hit and you will know that he suits that chic and cold man character like Do Kyungsuk. wahh, im totally excited for this. i love the webtoon and chracters and i think this is gonna be great drama. cant wait~~ EUNWOO~~~~!!! so excited for this drama. hoping it turns out well! 화이팅!!! her character is born in 1999??? are we supposed to really believe that... Gangnam Beauty is a derogatory word for woman who obviously had plastic surgery. I absolutely love the webcomic and the meaning behind it. We shouldn\\'t be obsessed with the outward beauty to the point that we make a person feel like they aren\\'t of value because they don\\'t have certain features. Imagine being bullied for being deemed less attractive and then getting bullied for making changes to become more attractive. It seems like there is no end to it and you lose your individuality in the process. They should have casted a prettier actress, she\\'s not that beautiful as the name implies I hope this drama can be really as good as the webtoon version. Eunwoo style doesn\\'t really suit with Do Kyungsuk but I hope he can live the character I was reading new chapter of the webtoon then among the comments i saw this, this somewhat “old” news made my day? looking forward to it?? Do KyungSuk \\'s personality really does suit Cha Eunwoo. and all the actor and actress too. it was an amazing choice. i\\'ve read the whole manga, knowing that eunwoo will be stared as main character there made me excited like crazy although i already is. arohas are always proud of face genius Mr.Chadoomchit. aroha knows that eunwoo can adapt to this character as much as his personality does. Kwak dong yeon?????, i love you so much??, i am here always to support you, saranghae,??????, Eunwoo? Pleasee help mee, he is my bias in astro..????? If you said that you haven\\'t watch eunwoo in drama,you must watch him at drama THE BEST HIT, he can represent his role there:) just bcz of this drama I read the manga,, it\\'s so interesting!!!!! I\\'m so so curious ab8 the drama. I wanna watch it sooon i read the webtoon\\'s first chapter ang kyungseokn reminds me of Cha Eunwoo in Astro web drama \"To be Continued\". can\\'t way to see him!!!! Cha Eun-Woo is really handsome, just no words, the role of flower-boy suits hem well. But the problem is, that Kyungseok isn\\'t a flower-boy, he is taciturn and rude, and not smiling a lot. But I think it\\'s too early to judge, I\\'ll wait until the dorama comes out ... but as a reader of manhwa, I did not represent him for the role of Kyungseok ... Cha Eun-Woo is really handsome, just no words, the role of flower-boy suits hem well. But the problem is, that Kyungseok isn\\'t a flower-boy, he is taciturn and rude, and not smiling a lot.

But I think it\\'s too early to judge, I\\'ll wait until the dorama comes out ... but as a reader of manhwa, I did not represent him for the role of Kyungseok ... Cha Eun-Woo Is it just me who think Cha Eun Woo doesn\\'t suit playing Kyungseok? don\\'t get me wrong dude is beautiful and all but he is too kind looking to play a fierce looking kind of mean Kyungseok? also I never seen him in any drama before but look wise I\\'m not convinced. If this is the dude from lookism he would be perfect casting, but as Kyungseok... I just don\\'t think he isn\\'t. Please considering I become Sua. She looks match with the character Still waiting who will be Sua, must be very very beauty right Eunwoo~ <3 Lim Soohyang eonnie is the best choice!! I can\\'t wait!!! Kwak Dong-Yeon? supporting again?:3 Oh! I waited a long time to watch a Cha Eun Woo oppa\\'s drama. Hope this gonna be interesting.. Cha Eunwoo????? Hwaitingg i love the webtoon but this as a kdrama, umm....well, i do really want to watch it. hope for the best. well, let just wait and see. Been waiting on Lim Soo Hyang to return to drama after Lovers In Bloom, but not sure how I feel about EunWoo as her leading man. Omg yes! Cha Eunwoo as Kyungsuk! Loved him in The Best Hit. I wonder who will be Sua? Maybe Bona can pull it off they already cast Cha Eunwoo Do Kyung Seok. He\\'s too handsome than necessary for the role really. Cha Eunwoo have a bright image in real life but I think he can pull a cold & arrogant role. can\\'t wait for this drama! I think park hyunsik as kyungsuk is good? and chaeyeon DIA as Sua? Wow they going to make it into a drama. I currently reading it. yay fighting oppa ji soo for the lead role fighting',\n",

       "  'comments': 'One of the best medical dramas I have seen. Excellent writing, plot, set up, dynamic characters. Sometimes it feels too much to ask for a really refreshing storyline with superlative acting. This really did have it all. The first episode felt really dismal so I put off finishing it. I am so glad I went back to it. Excellent television. It wasn’t just thought-provoking, it was emotional and entertaining. The health service and money: it’s a global issue worldwide and I’ve seen a few drama’s American and Korean that touch upon these issues, dramatise it and brush everything under the carpet but the conversations in this were very familiar, employees at every level have their own understanding and opinion on what should be deserved from their country’s health care system. If anything deserves a season 2: it is this. I want to hear more from the nurses next time. Special mention to Cho Seung Woo whose other dramas I have obviously been deprived of till now and Lee Dong Wook’s face; how can a person’s face emit charisma????? I love Cho Seung Woo\\'s acting....and I love the chemistry between Pres. Gu and Dr. Lee No Eul. Please pd nim recruite them in another drama as a couple asap... Cho Seung Woo is the best, he is the definition of perfect! Cho Seung Woo, one of the best actors in Korea! Since I watch The King’s Doctor(2012) I was mesmerized by his talent. The portrayal of President Gu was outstanding! Waiting for his next drama?? I really hope there is season 2! Amazing medical/business drama! I lovelovelove Cho Seung Woo\\'s acting in everything. He brings life to all the character he plays and always avoid being stereotyped because he is so amazing with portraying every character. I just finished watching it and I am so empresses from all the acting and story. I can’t wait to see season 2. I am a nurse and was so impressed with how authentic and real this series portrayed medicine vs business! Whoaaaaa never see an American series tell the truth. Great show, outstanding acting. Please make season 2, we are waiting.... excellent work! hope they\\'ll make a season 2 i love Mr Gu,, good character on his drama I watch this as I am a fan of Lee Dong Wook and Cho Seung Woo. Glad to watch them act in this drama after Goblin and Stranger. Never expect this turn out one of the best medical drama. I am glad to see Kim Won Hae here. I love he acts in a funny way in other dramas. I like Yoo Jae Myung too. Watched he acted as a father in Strong Woman Da Bong Soon and Stranger. Hey, does anyone know the actor of the driver for Mr. Gu? i love him!!!! Wow!! gotta see this drama LDW & most of “stranger ” drama cast Since JTBC is a paid channel, the ratings are already considered high. Wowwwwww What a drama Writer and Director a big thumbs up to them.Every actor do their best.Don\\'t bother about ratings some dramas can\\'t measured with ratings and it is one of them.Beautiful cinematography. love love love LDK CSW <3<3 Love to see Lee Dong Wook. Very good drama, one of my favorite drama of Lee Dong Wook. The cast are superb. I like cho seung woo in this drama, and in drama stranger too..... he is good actor i suddenly want a romance movie of cho seung woo with won jin-a Warning: maybe contain spoiler (it could be a big spoiler, sorry) one of d best kdrama.... Beautiful chemistry between Ye jin wook and reporter Choi seo hyun.... Joo kyung moon and Oh se hwa such a great partners for hospital. I\\'m gonna miss this drama especially Ye brothers Seo Dong Jae is back I love how it ended. Changes come and life goes on. Will miss this. underrated drama...great drama that highlight on medical management instead of medical practices..good approached..very enjoyable to watch Oh god such a nice ending.... I like it so much, but I just hope Lee No-eul at least hugs CEO, Koo Seung-Hyo. Beautiful ending for Ye Sibling I want LeE Dong Wook (Ye Jin Woo )and Won Jin-a(Lee No Eul)to end up together..???? I cant believe time runs so fast Life drama is approaching two final episodes ...curious to know the ending of the saga.. I don\\'t want this drama to end. The Chemistry between, Ye Jin Woo and reporter Choi Seo Hyun, President Gu and Lee No Eul hope they will end up together. Glad that Director Oh will come back this coming episode. looking forward for the join forces of Director Oh, Chief Joo Kyung Moon and President Gu to beat the Chairman of Hwajeong Group. epsiode 14 was so intense ....... huhuhuhu and this drama will end next week. T_T OMG.... Episode 14 is the best episode, like this drama so much First Korean medical drama where the action doesn\\'t take place in the or. Also a lot of their patients die in the er, another departure from the usual doctor savants that are the heroes in previous shows. A very interesting show. @hanbyeori, keep watching it and you\\'ll know why. can someone explain why jinwoo always sees his brother at the hospital? im so confused:( im currently at ep 2 and so many things confused me . hopefully I won\\'t drop this drama The drama is awesome. Love so much? Thanks a lot for the writer. All of actor and actress and all of crew. Your hardword is daebakkk??????????????? Based on the synopsis alone, I am adding this series onto my list of dramas to watch. As someone who works in an emergency department, this drama can only make me shake my head at how unrealistic it is, or make me satisfied that it is somewhat realistic. I sure hope it is the latter because honestly, the stuff we deal with at work from both sides, patients/visitors and management, is portrayed often in television series, and most are unrealistic. Shows like that makes it even more difficult for us because patients and visitors think they know it all when they do not. As for management, there is a ton of politics and the emergency department is ALWAYS the underdog. We are underfunded, but deal with the highest volume, the most demanding patients/visitors, and get patients dumped onto us when something goes wrong anywhere in the hospital. Lee Dong Wook .....Saranghae Really good drama so far. Seung Woo is very good actor but his character really don\\'t know what he wants. He is real businessman and he sees that it\\'s different leading a hospital with business methods but can\\'t give up them as he gives up himself. His relationships with No Eul is somehow unreal to me even ridiculous. As if she is the first woman who says him hi to get attached to her. Won Jin A is very good actress too but her character is annoying. She is really naive and obviously likes helping lonely people and people in pain not considering that it may lead to bad feelings and regrets in the end. She doesn\\'t see or doesn\\'t want to see Koo Seung Hyo real intentions and gets close to him. Lee Dong Wook is the perl in this drama. He cares not only about his future but the future of the hospital. I like his devotion to patients. He maybe like No Eul but don\\'t allow himself these feelings because of his brother and that\\'s why he got easily atractted to a beautiful woman. Hope he and No Eul eng up together. Joo Kyung Moon is likeable person and he will get even more if he finds the strength to fight with stupid and greedy people who think only about themselves. I can\\'t predict what will happen next and I hope I won\\'t be disappointed. Loving how I don\\'t know if I should like Cho Seung Won or not! Such clever writing of a character! Nice medical drama which show how important doctors are and what they should do. It is not a place of business. I am coming to hate Lee No-Eul . Seung ho i think his thinking will change (that everything is not business). Jin Woo and Sun Woo their relationship is so nice. Cho Seung Woo and Tae In Ho bad-assing together is just THE BEST. Tae In Ho\\'s luck, such a cutie face but always ending up playing evil... Lol Am i the only one that thinks that this drama deivated from its initial plot, It started out as an invenstigation on who killed the hospital director and now it is.. i dont even know what it is, Its just there and they are pushing into more of a triangle love thing. I love this. Drama. Love Lee Dong Wook and at.at all in this drama. Great Drama!best medical drama I have ever seen until now! I love this drama. But I don’t like the couple that everyone seems to be shipping. I don’t like Mr. Gu and I don’t think they look good together. I think it would be improper for them to become a couple. Am sure Mr. Gu would be so cold and calculating as to know how bad it is for his career to have a relationship in the workplace. I love this drama..at first it was kind of dragging and a bit confusing but I pursue it because of the cast specially Cho Seung Woo,Won Jin Ah and Lee Dong Wook and all the supportung casts.Currently on ep 7 and it\\'s getting better and better??.After reading comments here Im so happy to know that Im not the only one shipping Gu Seung Yu and Lee No Eul my God they\\'re giving me butterflies everytime there together on screen..LIFE fighting ill be watching this drama till the end?? Nice medical drama...its confusing but its doing well to understand.... I am shipping Koo seung Hyo and Lee No eul. Hope they will end up together . They look good together. Koo Seung hyo is showing his soft side to Lee No Eul only and I feel he is feeling something for her. I feel like he is communicating well with her , not as a cold business man but like a man and worry for her sometimes. He is different when he is with her. I want them to end up together . I will be disappointed if they don’t end up together. I know this is medical drama and can’t get high hopes but still I can’t stop my shipping. I\\'m shipping Guys Seung Hyo and Lee No Eul... They look perfect together.... Love them both. The drama line is impressive. I\\'m so related since I\\'m also a medical student. Love this drama Love this drama❤ I love how each character is so in depth. My heart bounces so much when watching the episodes, wishing for more minutes in each epi. It is so real. Hands down to the writer and the director of this show. Tae Inho\\'s character as a organ donor specialist is also moving, he seems cold, but true to his job. Just thumbs up. CSW\\'s character is the best thing about this show. Every scene he is is he steals the show. Don\\'t know about anyone else but I am tired of seeing naive lead characters and am glad CSW is a realist. You cannot run a hospital without making \\'real\\' choices; idealism is great but it is not practical. Wow brothers relationship is so nice. Sun Woo proposing to No Eul he took a brave step. I don\\'t know may be because of CSW character I am hating him and I don\\'t like him to be paired with No Eul. Ye Jin-Woo his character is being developed so nicely. this drama i am not interested in romance. Enjoying it I love the coldness of the characters. All this hospital politics reminds me of how good Kdramas can be. Don\\'t know why this drama reminds me of the \\'The Good Fight\\', also one of my favorite shows; and both have exceptional writing. Hope these characters stay cold and get even darker. Love shows with characters that don\\'t incorporate typical Kdrama \\'hero\\' cliches. My favorite Kdrama since \\'Signal\\' and \\'Stranger\\' hands down, One of best shows out there. Finally a show with good writing that does focus on romance as its main theme. Man goosebumps everytime Cho Seung Woo goes serious-mode. Can guys like Kdramas? Who care I\\'m a guy and I admit this currently my favorite show. Oh God... I am looking forward for episode 7 and 8 really want to know where the writer brings us to ... perfect assemble of the casts awesome amazing brilliant outstanding I\\'m hooked. Am from the UK and it started to be shown here last week. There are so many parallels here to our own NHS in Britain. Managers trying to run it like a business, our present government would like to privatise everything. Hospitals are understaffed and overworked, but they do a brilliant job nonetheless, and we have had hospitals that have mad mistakes and then there were our junior doctors that went on strike last year. Wondering if the writer of this series has studied what has happened in Britain, or does this happen in Korea as well? My belief is that you can\\'t run a health service like any other business. Did you mean CSW\\'s character or he as an actor? LOL. Have not watched it yet. Still waiting for it to finish. But if he is annoying bec of the character, then he is doing a great job since he is the antagonist right? I hope they don\\'t wade into love triangle territory... Gosh.. Cho Seung Woo is so annoying. Feels like to smash him... After the ending of each episode, I was like this drama is crazy... goddamn different. Thank yoy writer for something out of the box.. This is not about medical drama per say but more to what happen behind the top management.. Keep up the good works.. For a Stranger reunion, this made me expected too much. But pilot episode was boring. I wonder whether the next episodes could make me sit through. I dont understand why Lee Dong Wook sees his brother at times eventhough it was nit real. If you have watch Stranger, then this drama will definitely feel like Stranger cast reunion??? definitely watching! Loving this drama so far! The cast is amazing! I normally watch rom/com but this one definitely has my interest! Lee Dong Wook can do no wrong! Such a phenomenal actor! Actually the entire cast is really amazing! This is basically Stranger cast reunion..I\\'ve only watched the first episode because it took so long for the drama to get subtitled..but it was intense for the first episode..watching this because of Cho Seung Woo..but all the cast are amazing..Cho Seung Woo is the best.. I don’t know if it’s just me.... first episode is already boring.. it’s so dull and I don’t get it why they have to be so mad to work at rural areas if they are truly doctors. So far episode 1 disappoints me ☹️☹️☹️ I just finished watching 4 episodes life drama with subtitle at netflix... OMG such an amazing story, perfect casts, outstanding performance .. I enjoyed it so much .. awesome team life drama Worth watching. From Screenwriter who write Secret Forest (Stranger). And Director who direct beautiful drama like Dear My Friends, Live Up to Your Name, Most Beautiful Goodbye, etc. And last but not least, Just look at those names (Im glad all of them are TRULY ACTORS not Idol or even singer). Cho Seung-woo, Lee Dong-wook, Won Jin-ah, Lee Kyu-hyung, Yoo Jae-myung, etc. Full of Top Quality Korean Actors. You can trust them. Lee Dong Wook,the most fine actor will definetly give us Master peace. LDW bless you. Solely watching this for Lee Dong-wook. What a brilliant actor!:3 Waiting so bad for this drama! Can\\'t wait to see Cho seung woo oppa again in a drama! Does anyone know where to watch this legally in us? Netflix? Thanks! Isn\\'t it released today? Not the 23rd? i meant cho seung woo...oh my god lol The same writer of Stranger, director from Dear My Friends?? Cha Seung Won? and some casting from Stranger? goddamnit im in!!!! WAHH im excited Cheon Ho Jin is Playing as a doctor again?? Jin-a fighting♥ Omo! I was waiting for him so long!! Cho Seung Woo Oppa!! Secret forest was great but I missed his charm from God\\'s Gift 14 Days. He is back. Yeaee!! Saranghae ❤️ I thought this drama will compete Mr. Sunshine... I think they put this on Mon & Tue so that the ratings will not beat. I cant wait for more teaser pics. This is so exciting but 3 weeks away Can\\'t wait for my King Wook\\'s comeback. Really hope that there will be place for Life in knetz hearts after Mr.Sunshine will start and will create a decease called \"another Kim Eun Suk\\'s epic hit\". My favorite Wook\\'s drama is not Goblin or Hotel King. It\\'s Wild Romance and La Dolce Vita. Wonder if Life will replace or at least will share first place in my heart. 23rd July, come faster. Im so excited to watch this drama, I love Jo Seung Woo, he is brilliant actor..Fighting Jo Seung Woo!!! I simply LOVE LDW’s teaser poster! His stare and the overall atmosphere of the picture is so suspenseful and intense. I also love how creative it is. One part of Ye Jin-woo’s face is hidden in the dark, so perhaps he will have a dark side as well. I can’t wait to see uri Doctor Ye’s intense acting soon!! Fighting!! CSW and LDW! Swoon! I\\'m so looking forward to this drama. Love both actors. CSW gave me a very good impression in FoS which led me to watch all of his movies. LDW, I love him since My GIrl and my favorite drama of his is Hotel King (don\\'t be surprised if it\\'s not Goblin, I just thinkliked the plot of Hotel King better). Heard a lot of good feedback about Won Jin Ah. Looking forward to her as well and how she can deliver. Life Kdrama Hwaiting!. Lee Dong Wook ( Ye Jin - Woo ) Fighting! Have watched all teasers and so excited for this drama. The quality should be on a different level. I\\'m swept by Lee Dong Wook\\'s voice. My first drama with this actor was \"Bubblegum\" and his narrations were one of the best strong points in drama. Then I have checked that he was Dj in army and not only this explained why his voice is used as voice cover in some other dramas as well. I hope in Life they won\\'t miss to use his voice for narration. I might be a pervert here, but I have butterflies in my stomach even when his character announces DOA. Looking forward to this drama as the potential Drama of the year. Overall casting seems the best I have ever seen in dramas. I am new kdrama fans ,I have only watched couple of dramas two years ago then I get busy with life but Bubblegum was one them ,I lOve it ,the male lead \\'s voice was SO warm ,I still remember it coz the narration was beautiful so when I felt like watching korean dramas again , my crazy Kdrama friends recommended me to wait for ,\"life \" the teaser is so intriguing so I am waiting for life and I will enjoy come and hug me till july Just can\\'t get over Secret Forest\\'s soundtrack... My king is back with mysterious poster for a doctor ❤ my lovely looney is on this one.. hahah finally a new project for him?? a prison playbook fanatic here?? i just hanyang?? im in for this one just for him??? Now about fteasers and Ye Jin Woo\\'s (Lee Dong Wook) poster. I\\'m so hooked to this drama already and so proud to see how LDW takes another challenge. When some actors are sticking to the same genres after successful dramas (and some are even to same writers), he\\'s always choosing something we don\\'t expect him to choose. He never plays two similar (or at least a bit similar) roles or genres in a row. He said that he has rejected many fantasy and romance dramas after hit Goblin because he doesn\\'t want to close himself in one genre/role. And just look at his poster. Nothing from Grim Reaper or Park Ri Hwan from Bubblegum. If he\\'d choose romance or fantasy after Goblin, he\\'d gain so much more benefits from that. Both Koreans and international kdrama fans love when actors are sticking to same genre or type of characters. Its a win win combo. But we can say for sure that LDW won\\'t choose another suspense drama after Life. So proud of him. And so curious about his poster. Does it hint that Ye Jin Woo is not that good as normally protagonist doctor\\'s in kdramas are? I think do not love in drama, drama look focus between money and humanity Cant wait for this drama but dont want ms. Hammurabi to end either I hope this drama doesn\\'t show a love triangle, cz I don\\'t want to see CSW have one sided love I am so ready for this Won jin A is in this so it\\'s gonna be good!! So, this drama will be vs with Mr Sunshine for get drama of the year title, dabongggg Sounds awfully like White Tower... Will wait and see what the production team and cast bring to the \"hospital power struggle\" genre. LOL at cho seung woo\\'s face >.<\" I still can imagine he making face from secret forest. But damn. I\\'m so hyped for this! Totally gonna watch this xD Oh my god team Secret Forest is back LOL Lee Kyu-Hyung, Choo Seung-Woo, Yoo Jae-Myung, Tae In-Ho. I\\'m so happy ya\\'ll Ma babies are back but why no Bae Doo Na though??? Good Drama needs teamwork ,chemistry and Harmony. during Goblin we and GY\\'s fans have mutual respect to each bias . Lee KyuHyung is here too?! Yayyy! On a bright note all actors are looking damn fine at script reading. You can feel the power of this cast even from pics. And I love the description of Lee Dong Wook\\'s character. We have already spotted his charisma and passion (mentioned in Korean articles) from various fan cams. Can\\'t wait to know more! You probably don\\'t know a lot of things if you beieve CSW isn\\'t an A-lister. He\\'s one of the highest paid actor in Kmovie industry. So maybe do some research. Yessss.... I came here cuz of won jin a. Her acting in Just Between Lovers was outstanding and my opinion is still the same. This drama is also great! Yay! I love all these actors. Won Jin A, even though new, is a plain gem. Plus, Lee Dong Wook and Jo Seung Woo are both such great veteran actors! Hwaiting! FYI. Cho Seung Woo is one of the highest paid actors in Korea. He is an A List actor. LDW is also great. I\\'ve watched him in several dramas. CSW, I\\'ve watched his dramas and movies. I am a fan of both actors. I\\'m looking forward to this drama. Whatever you guys say, both actors are talented. Lee Kyu Hyung confirmed too!!... YAAAAYYY!!! after watched his works which is Tazza,God Gift, stranger etc. im excited for this drama. Cho Seung Woo ahjussi fighting!! Oh crap. fans wars have already started? Who is better? Well, let\\'s just face the truth. None of them is A list actor. Both are close, but not there. Lee Dong Wook is more known as heartthrob of kdrama while Cho Seung Woo plays another type of roles and in movies more. Both are great in their own field. In Life Lee Dong Wook challenges himself again and again as he has promised totally new character which he has never played. Character for him is the most important but he really appreciates working in team. He has told only good things about CSW and others. It will be LDW responsible for team\\'s mood and chemistry between cast. Who knows, maybe we\\'ll have another awesome bromance(s). And for those who doubt his acting potential and Goblin\\'s characters are not enough, go and check noir drama \"La Dolce Vita\" and...shut up. None of your biases has done THIS in the age of 25. And I found they have ever tried such deep and controversial characters or dramas. Well, the only thing I doubt that you are capable to watch such deep drama as \"La Dolce Vita\" and understand it. Cho seung woo is my top5 actor...the best actor in kcinema.... I\\'m waiting for Woo Jin A.. hope her role as great as previously in JBL even more improve, can\\'t wait! Jo Seung Woo indeed is one of the best actor on Kdrama industry. He has a very impressive filmography. I forgot to mention Tazza and Go G0 70s.:) @Zeid . He is one of the best actors out there. I\\'ve watched almost all of his movies (Classic, Love Phobia, Marathon, Who are you, Sword with no name) and his dramas (Secret Forest and GG14 Days). I just love him so much! So talented. You want to know Jo Seung Woo watch his movie Marathon 2005 on Netflix as well as Inside Men and his show Stranger... He is a chameleon of an actor Lee dong wook is the best actor. He is really good at acting and always give us a different person when he acts. All the drama he do the character are way to different so we have the chance to see him in different ways. ?? = smiley face. Heart eyes face JIN-A!!?? Watching this for Cho Seung Woo! @Rasta When I take a look at the way he\\'s portrayed all the roles he\\'s played so far, I really can\\'t agree with you....Just compare his role as \\'Cha Jae Wan\" on Hotel King to his role as \"Park Moo Yeol\" on Wild Romance. It\\'s like he is a totally different person. In \"Goblin\" he basically played three different characters: The Grim Reaper, Wang Yeo and Lee Hyuk, and he\\'s managed to give all three of them a different vibe. His acting as the GR was nothing like the way he portrayed Wang Yeo. As Lee Hyuk, he had a more easygoing and charming flare, and he portrayed that role just as convincing. I guess art is in the eyes of the beholder, but to me he\\'s a unique and outstanding actor because he acts with emotion and because he\\'s convincing....I believe him when he acts....unlike a lot of other actors who are known to be good, but act without passion. Have decided to watch it for Jo Seung-Woo and the writer Lee Soo-Yeon. Add to that Moon Soo-Ri... I\\'m ecstatic. These are acting heavy-weight. Well let\\'s wait until the premiere and it\\'s not a competition of sorts it\\'s a collaboration and with the Director at the helm ( whom I admire from watching Dear my friends and Live up to your name) I guess we are in safe hands along with a trusted writer who scored well with their debut of Stranger then this will be a must watch drama in July. Furthermore we can\\'t make grandiose statements against who is better then who rather let\\'s support the cast chosen because the last thing I would want is fans of LDW to hit up this page and start an epic full scale debate etc.....Its already started on a couple of other drama pages here on AW and it is distracting and not pleasant reading. @Ann Joel, I agree with @k2. LDW while is a good actor doesn\\'t really fit the term \"superb\". I\\'d call actors like Ha Jeong Woo or Bae Doona \"superb\" not him. CSW is closer to the term. As for WJA, she\\'s new to the industry and is a fledgling actress with potential. Let\\'s wait and see how she does here. We\\'ve yet to see her spectrum. Plz cast Jung so min Congratz Won Jin Ah! I will watch this because: Cho seung woo, won jin ah, medical drama, and lee dong wook. Won jin ah\\'s acting in Just between lovers captured my heart. Aja aja fighting:D ....July to find out. @k2 LDW debuted in 1999 WJA was born in 1991. That\\'s nearly 20 years of being in the industry for LDW. WJA started in 2015 and had a meteoric rise that others can just dream of! JBL was well received then BOOM she scored the female lead in Live. She is still emerging hence why not many people know of her. However I sincerely hope she is able to hold her own like I mentioned in my previous comment. As for LDW not being superb in your eyes his acting resume is quite extensive and I must admit I\\'ve only seen him in Bubblegum 2015 and The Perfect Couple 2007 and he did well in both so I have no complaints at all with his acting. I guess we have to wait until @annjoel no offense to Lee Dong Wook, he is good but I dont consider him as superb actor, If she played it right, Won Jin Ah’s depth is greater than Lee dong wok but of course she is a rookie and a lot hasn’t watched JBL, hence the hype isn’t much. Finally LDW will be back with another drama:3 Lee Dong-wook hwaiting!!! Can’t wait to see you act again:D so excited to see won jin ah and lee dong wook together!!!! Excited for this. Cho Seung Won is a wonderful actor. Add in LDW and a very promising new actress Won Jin A and you\\'ve a recipe for success. Anticipating this. Although it\\'ll feel weird seeing Won JinA with an actor other than Junho since those two had superb chemistry in JBL yeayyy pretty won jin a gets a lead role here Won Jin A as female lead with LDW and CSW as main leads will be interesting and I wonder if this is going to have a classic love triangle scenario incorporated into a the storyline? I hope WJA can hold her own with these 2 K actor heavyweights if there is and her character is likeable and feisty enough to propel the drama along. Judging from the lack of response to WJA I think people are somewhat perplexed at the casting news cos honestly I was. However good on her it will another opportunity to shine just like she did in Just Between Lovers. If there is romance in this drama, i want Won jinA to end up with Lee dong wook.hehe If there is romance romance story in this drama,i want Won JinA to end up with Lee dong wook.hehe If there is a romance story in this drama, I want Won Jin A to end up with Lee Dong wook..hehe Wowwwww, my cho seung woo oppa is there. What a great actor. Excited to see this drama. Han Hyo Joo eonnie pls to be lead female Also, I wouldn\\'t mind if they cast an idol for the female lead if they are good for e.g Uee, Sooyoung, etc (although Uee seems to be working on another drama). Cho Seung Woo? I\\'m in. What a good actor he is. Yeeyyyy oppa lee dong wook come back!!!! Finally ldw is back! <3 #foreverwookie fighting!!! Wookie is come back ❤️ Please cast Jung So Min as the female lead.. Can i just dream....? Love HJM to be in this drama. at least a supporting role...? thank you! I am absurdly excited for this with just two names being announced. + It will be screened on JTBC. + It\\'s the same writer as Stranger. Smells like something to anticipate. wookie z back <3 i agree Gong Hyo Jin would be great as a lead... other than this there should be casting call and chemistry test between any future paring... Waiting .. Can\\'t wait for watching this drama. Please cast Gong Hyo Jin as the female lead... Please Gong Hyo Jin... Thank You... ^_^ LDW, fighting! Shin Hye Sun for the female lead. I really want her to be paired again of Cho Seung Woo. Please writer-nim you cast her already in your previous work which is Secret Forest... But if there\\'s a chance please don\\'t kill her again this time lol both are my fav in the drama.what else is needed. Our Grim Reaper has returned for doctor\\'s role can\\'t wait for this....................... can\\'t wait. Please park so dam as female lead I want a good actress.... please don\\'t cast an idol or someone looks as baby or cute near to the two actors.... we want solid performance even from the lead actress.. and I don\\'t choose someone only because her last drama have a good rating ... please make casting call and test the chemistry between the leads ... change the game of Korean drama casting a little bit Please cast Shin Hye Sun please...please...she is very good in acting...her current drama have high ratings! Please cast an ACTRESS, not an IDOL. Cast someone who has great acting skills. Please match the acting skills of the two male leads. Don\\'t waste Jo Seung and Lee Dong Wook\\'s talents. Yes, yes yes! Can\\'t hardly wait!!! Just so happy that Jo Seung-woo will back to dramaland again?? Please cast yoo in na to be the female lead. I would be glad to see the lovely couple again in a drama. I love them both as I watch the goblin. Kindly give them another chance ❤ Looking forward ❤❤ omg!! i really like cho seung woo a lot!! and can\\'t wait to see him in new drama .. fighting~ seems promising~ worth to wait~ especially bcs there\\'s best two lead actor in here~:D Can you please stop referring to Lee Dong Wook as the grim reaper only? He is already frustrated and depressed enough thinking that he might\\'ve had fallen into a pit where everyone will just remember that one role he had. He has spoken about this matter and people should not only praise his Grim reaper character but others as well. I know it is by far the most famous character he had, better than his character as Kong Chan in My Girl and Ji Wook in Scent of a Woman but please give him a break. Wow... Cho Seung Woo in drama again! Fighting! Bae Doona again please:) ahhh oppa together have made my day lee dong wook and cho seung woo please cast yoo in a as female lead fighting Mr. Black and Mr. Grimreaper and they’ll be doctors I\\'m looking forward to see these combos! Lee dong wook? Cho seung woo, fighting! Yesss... Here you are cho seung woo-nim',\n",

       "  'comments': 'This is art, and a story, so ... I see they got through any \"obstacle\" and they are together. In a better \"place\", they even mend up the older story... they do not break up... they create, they build a story... the cinema is like a place where you show stories you like, the town is a place where you live the story life you like, she decided to be in a place/life she likes... she set him free, she set herself free. A big friend, and model her former work friend. We create our own life... The previous one... was an uncomfortable one for her and her former boyfriend. Fear of loss… makes us prisoners. I just realized Yumeaki was 15 during the course of the drama. SO three years later he would be eighteen. Legally would be able to continue dating Wako. Therefore the showing of his movie was like the showing of their love finally being legal and they could stay together. This is the first time I watched jdrama.. and definitely at first I feel so absurd??.. but I was amazed and hooked with the story. I just finished it only in just one week though i still have other activities and work to do. It realized and learned me one thing about love maturity. It just transforms you in a right way though we have really to face all the obstacles to make us strong to choose on being true with our own kind of happiness. Love will always be together with trust and hope. well this was absolutely disgusting Thumbing around Netflix I wound hitting it by accident. I enjoyed the photography so I stayed. Loved it! Story was not to over the top to be believable, even if the subject was dicey. I really enjoyed the way the female lead was portrayed Yeah a piece like this in the US at this current political moment and climate could not be made. Kinda like My Father My Hero, the original French film was loved the US one hated. I kind of stopped watching jdramas but I thought I should give this one a try and I definitely do not regret it!!! Pulling of a love story that sounds like a pedo shoujo manga is nearly impossible ... but to me, the director managed to show it in a realistic and beautiful way. I loved this shows slow artsy feel....The chemistry between the leads made their fears and struggles believable and thus even more heart aching... Fantastic Script, writing. But can someone explain the end is Wako still with Yuneaki or did he run off to the other high school girl? Does the director want us to not know> An impressive, sensual and emotional drama. I appreciated every moment! The love story between the two main character is so passionate, it’s absolutely mind-blowing! and the acting is unexpectedly stunning. I haven’t seen such a drama for so long! Umm how did it end ... did they stay together ... did they go separate ways ... they never really say what happened three years later Surprisingly good. I really enjoyed it because of the chemistry between the 2 main characters. A believable plot watching a 31 year old come into her own feelings as a result of the realtionship with a 15 year old boy. Explicit, but tasteful with a satisfying ending. I will watch again. By the way, the actor playing the 15 year old is beautiful! Great drama!! A well shot story about a woman commiting statutory rape:). You need to suspend a lot to enjoy this properly since it plays out like a doujin (both in the narrative and visuals) most of the time. Treat it as such and you\\'ll have a good enough time. Explicit yet tasteful, the chemistry between Wako and Yumeaki is unbelievable,,,beautiful, beautiful, I watched it 3x already haha. Really good! I saw it yesterday on Netflix and I have to say it\\'s the best thing I\\'ve seen in a long time. The scenarios (especially in the last chapter... just WOW, especially the pier and the noria, left me breathless for a moment), the plot, and that chemistry between the main couple despite the age difference, I felt a hole in my stomach every time they were together. Each character was very well achieved, nothing left over. So real, raw, romantic and passionate. 100 to this work of art! Highly recommended. Photography, actors and music are perfect. As Sahara says, min-blowing, oniric and sensual. Great chemistry between the couple. The cinematography in this motion picture is just...mind-blowing.',\n",

       "  'comments': 'the plot was too flat from the beginning so i lost interest very fast finally couldnt stand it and dump it by epi 16 i also dumped the 2 dramas from kbs2 that preceded this one i really like kbs2 and i always watch their dramas regardeless but i think i was very unlucky with thsese 3 dramas the plots were just not for me too boring too flat Yoon Jung-Han doesn\\'t deserve Han Ka-Young i dislike him for what he did. Did not love it to the end. Dragged on only for a lukewarm revenge. Unbelievable how this writer could keep this lengthy drama interesting...never a dull moment and people actually get revenge as well as atonement. Great cast! The hairstyles change over time and perfect makeup. More and more people tuned in...OHHH that Se-Na!!!!...perfectly acted. I don\\'t like GY back together with JH. He married Emily and they acted to be real couple. Guess during their marriage kissing scene did occur, am I right? I dislike him so much. I\\'d prefer HK for GY or just send a very nice and handsome man for her and let JH regret for being so caring to Emily and for marring her. I really dislike the family of JH (his mother and JB). If JB and HG reunite, then have GY meet a better mate Just watched ep 97 and I just cant wait for it to be finally over. The writers better have some really good stuff up their sleeves coz its all getting old now. Drawing near the end of this series, I’m so glad the plots have become more exciting with each episode! The bad guys are getting a taste of their own medicine! I’m really really hoping for reuniting not only Kang Hyun Ki and Jung Bin but most especially Ka Young and Yoon Jung Han. The light and comedic moments of Jae Dong and Hae Rin are wonderfully place in the chaotic scenarios in the episodes. Congratulations to the directors and writers for making these last episodes most enjoyable! Am I the only who miss Ji Hoon? (Team Jihoon and Haeri!) Honestly Emily is beginning to really raise my frustration through the roof, he doesn\\'t love you sis please unsubscribe that Love isn\\'t by force ugh Teacher can I walk with him, I’m his mom’s friend... Whoever told the writer to add that must have gotten their job based on connections. Poor for GY. I dissapointed with this drama. Why Sena looks super power and her bad never end hahaha, i don\\'t understand with drama. And writter likes Sena of the Ga Young. Look time scene Sena and compare with ga young. I Thinks Sena is Main Cast and Ga Young only additional player?? Meanwhile, I will just read what\\'s happening in the drama in discussion forums...I don\\'t think I have that much enthusiasm to keep watching all the nasty stuff therein anymore especially during this season/time of the year. I just hope the writer will put a really shining bright light at the end of the tunnel...also, I hope that in the future, they will choose themes that will put more importance to admirable Korean values rather than aim for high viewership/rating Until now I cannot understand why the drama title is \\'Love Until the End\\'....when most of the time it has depicted Mockery of Love until now that it\\'s 3 weeks to the final episode .. marry/cohabitate with HK in exchange for the cosmetics company? And GY reasoned earlier that she agreed to be engaged to HK to protect her son? Sena is sinister..the main protagonist is confused with what is right&wrong..and chooses wrong too.. tsk tsk Okay I\\'ve decided to wait till drama is over with.. Can\\'t watch her marry the Kang Hyun-Ki because she doesn\\'t belong with him and he belongs with Jung Bin.. Also can\\'t stand Emily, I can\\'t live with out you crap... He has never loved you so get over yourself.. Happy Ending for the important people please.. Emily and Se Na just need to be gone gone gone... It looks like Jung Bin deserves 20x better treatment for her 20-year wait for love...if not from Hyun Ki, then from a way way much better man Poor Jung Bin...:( Poor Jung Bin? Is the writer going to kill Jung Han in the end and have Ga Young end up with Hyun Ki? What a tragic end would that be? And at Christmas time as well???? How long do we have to endure the evilness of the antagonists in this drama? I hope the writer will spend the next 20 episodes or so highlighting the nobility of the human spirit in the protagonists. It\\'s become too tiresome to watch :(:(:( I’m getting so frustrated with episode 74, if episode 75 is another unbelievable win for Se Na. That’s it! I don’t want to watch anymore. I’ll just watch the final episode. There are other drama series more entertaining than this. Too fatalistic, always making the bad winning over the good. Viewers want to feel good as well, not frustrated. The writers should consider what their viewers want. Wow I feel like were being dragged by a choke collar in this show.. I love the actors but dang give us a happy ending soon.. cause the good people keep getting there butts handed to them.. ugh I can\\'t seem to stop watching it.. this drama has very bad timing KBS2 should make sure they follow the time table it published as people from out of korea stay up due to time different to watch this show with this unprofessional attitude and not value views support i will STOP watching KBS2 PROGRAM - BAD First off I\\'m so tired of Emily... omg she does not know her place, you can\\'t force love and she know\\'s her marriage is contract only.. but nooo she has to butt her head in where it doesn\\'t belong.. Second come on let the good guys get more going for them it seems more like they get a beat down every episode then getting anywhere.. and I want a happy ending sorry but with how this show has been I think we all deserve to see Jung-Han and Ka-Young happy with there son.. then also his sister and her man happy.. Don\\'t care one bit what happens to Emily never liked her when she first showed up. I\\'m watching this drama series over KBS World but it\\'s just puzzling why they pulled out the drama from their regular schedule and replaced it with another show. If I\\'m not mistaken it\\'s been a day or two already and no \\'Love To The End\\' airing on their scheduled program time. Hope they bring back the show soon. This drama transfixes me the most out of all that are out there during the Nov. 2018 time period. I’m into episode 68/100 and the villainess is still, literally, gettin away with murder. How is it possible she keeps getting a pass? The actress is playing her part so well that the line is blurred for me, between actress and role. She had better not pigeon hole herself into these types of characters otherwise I can see her getting hate mail from the netizens. I am so sorry for the male lead. He doesn’t deserve the admonishments he is getting, nor the bad luck. I know, all will be righted in the end, but 100 episodes is way too long for me. It’s exhausting to see all this evil. @Jamse, same here. I feel that Emily is the real Se Na. But I think, she’ll also take revenge against the fake one. Fake Se Na and the mother didn’t have idea that her real daughter Se Na survived from the hit and run. Also I noticed that Emily’s gesture whenever she sees Hyun Gi is like they have connection, perhaps because they are siblings. Not sure tho.. The tears are flowing! OMG more trouble ahead for this good family! I just want Se Na to start suffering real bad, as well as her evil, evil father!!! Please make Ga Young and Jung Hun join forces now!!! How much do you want to bet that Emily is the real Sena? That she didn’t die in the hit and run as a child, and since fake Sena convinced her mother to switch them it was believed that she was homeless, and put into an orphanage? Episode 66-if in the end, the Doo Young character will forgive and take back the super evil Se Na, then that\\'s Stupidity at its finest. Se Na character deserves to be punished for all the things she did. Doing evil is already second nature to her. Not even deserving to be a mother to her child. Where episode 64? Please release already. The plot thickens! I’m glad Ga Young finally admits she’s still in love with Jung Hun! I also like that they had shown that Emily is no better than Se Na. I think ka yong and hyyn ki can be united Oh no, I feel like...Emily will be the new antagonist once Kang Se Na is over. Okay Emily is on my hit list.. How dare her go and say that to Ka Young it really pissed me off.. and she is trying to make a contract marriage real.. ha ha he doesn\\'t love you... He loves Ka Young.. Wow I thought I\\'d really cry hard but I got through it well can\\'t wait for the rest of the episodes. Let me guess a kidnapping or custody fight? I just hope this drama will be true to its title \\'Love Until the End\\'...a happy ending for both couples - JH & GY and HK & Jung Bin...we need a feel-good reward for roller-coastering thru a 100 episodes. Oh my! I\\'m going to wait for the week\\'s episodes to come out and before watching..I just know episode 57 like 56 I\\'m going to be crying my eyes out.. I can\\'t get over his being married to Emily.. and coming back and pretty much like rub in the face to Ka Young it\\'s so wrong.. but hopefully it\\'s just a scam to for revenge and he somehow gets her to understand and love him again.. but who knows. Don’t be too quick to think that JoonHan is really married to Emily. I’m thinking that it’s all part of the revenge plot, that Emily didn’t really lose her memory and that they’re pretending to keep Gayoung out of it and safe. But finding out about his son is going to throw a wrench into the works. i stop watching this drama when JH meet GY and no with angry when meet her, was dissapointed. JH married Emily? Are You Kidding? left GY 6 years and JH marrid with Emily. That So Funny? I was so mad that JH is married to Emily.. I hope it\\'s just a cover and he is not.. He loves Ka Young not Emily.. and they need to be together.. She needs the happy ending. I\\'m so sad for her. sorry for Gayoung, she has been waiting for 6 years, but in return she has to accept the bitter truth, not only being left for 6 years by Jung Han but she is betrayed, she fate is very unfortunate because Han Jung has married Emily. The male lead character is very disappointing too selfish just because of revenge. jung han can give everything to Emily and marry Emily, even though Gayoung is a lot of sacrifices and hurts, please send another man who is more resilient to Gayoung, not a coward like Jung Han. the title, love must endure to the end, but the main male character leaves him gayoung himself, jung han is more evil than se na. because what was done was when se na left Jung Han, not sadistic Jung Han left Gayoung. need another tough guy for gayoung, please .. Ep 56 is so disappointing! Please, drama writer, please dont make it to be even more so by having Hyun-Ki court Ka-Young again now that JH is married to Emily.??? @APbox! It’s getting more exciting! Ep.54 is great! I’m glad Hyun Gi got a taste of what his father is capable of and it was all recorded! I’m also glad Ga Young’s father and brother are no longer idiots as portrayed in previous episodes! The transformation of Jung Han’s mother was spot on. I’ve seen her in other drama series and her roles usually portrayed her as stupidly naive, if there is such a word, now I find her more like a responsible mature woman who is, deep inside the same wonderful grandmother that she secretly wants to be! Good job to everyone in the production! I just wonder whether Emily was able to recover! I am patiently waiting! Jung Bin still lives with her mom in Ep 53. Does that mean she did not marry the guy she was supposed to 5 years ago? @Kats I am 100% with you and all your hopes. It all looks promising. I was loving episode 51 today. I enjoy seeing Se Na sweat and person ally the person I am most disappointed with is Jung Bin I felt she could have been a bridge between her mum and Ka Young but ah well she just seems miserable. Did she get married I wonder? Ah well till the next episode. APbox, I’m glad you agree with me! Ep. 51 looks promising! The last frames with Ga Young’s son and her long hair is making me so excited to see how she has transformed into a beautiful, loving, intelligent young single mother whom, I hope would smitten a rich and powerful Jung Han who arrives from New York with Emily! I truly hope the writers can sustain a more believable and relatable confrontation among the characters! Please make Ga Young look like the beautiful, sexy, intelligent, loving woman she should be! Bring back her energy and the driving force behind Cell Beauty!!! PLEASE!!! Been watching this from the start til now. From the episodes that Mr. Yoon was suffering due to loss of their land up to the latest episodes, I was always crying. Scenes were heartbreaking most especially when Ka-young is crying, i always got carried away. Can\\'t wait for the return of Jung Han. I am disappointed Jeong Han.Why did he divorce Ka yong.He is selfish mercilessly and cold bloddy that he can neglect Ka young eventhough he knows Ka young love him very much.Everything that @Kats, I agree. I was like that better not happen if not I will definitely give up on the drama. Please make Jung Bin and Hyung Ki end up with each other. They\\'re the main reason I am watching this drama In ep 49, if you let Ka-young have a miscarriage, I will stop watching! I can’t imagine how lame you made her character! You actually want to show that being evil like Se-Na’s character sends out the right message?! So unbelievable that she can get away with her lies and manipulations. It’s so irritating to watch when that happens! Only 50 episodes in and the Sena character is so unrelentingly evil, including multiple instances of attempted murder you wonder just how they’re going to sustain the story line for another 50 to 70 episodes. What\\'s the moral of the story? Nothing. I love Lee Young Ah as Baek Jang Mi, the story is logical & natural. Started watching because of Jung Hye In who is ‘Emily’ in this drama because I like her acting. That said I hope she gets more roles with lead one day....soon. Too talented and under appreciated plus she she aesthetically pleasing to the eye with her platinum blonde haircut. In other words she’s not a cookie cutter image like all the other K actresses. She actually stands out! Episode 47 - unbelievable! The action of the lead actor is not living up to the drama\\'s title. It is only the lead actress living up to it? Love to the end connotes unconditional love... I used to love Jang Mi (Lee Young Ah) but here I love Jeong bin\\'s outfit, my style indeed... Always delayed airing ep!???????? Where are ep 39 and 40? Joeng bin (sister of Jeong han) is really cool.... I like her Love this drama and can\\'t wait for episode 38. It has a good story, good actors and actresses and not forgetting the two good looking guys - Jung-Han and Hyun-Ki. @Darlene Johnson Would like to know \"Love to the End \" staring Lee Young Ah & Kang Eun-Tak as the lead actors, who plays the role of Emily, the best friend of Kang Se-Na (Hong Soo-A) when they were in the United States. Can\\'t seems to find out who she is. Would appreciate a respond to my question. Thank you Good drama series why has it been stopped Looking forward to seeing ep 24 to the end of this drama please New episode pleaseeeeee? I hate Se Na! She is soo selfish..U have no heart. ... let go young and jung hun be happy... how dare u to ruin their life. U can have your own and stay with that. The Sena character really is sadistic. She doesn’t just wreak havoc, she seems to enjoy it. i love it Please give more dramas to kang eun tak. He\\'s the best. I love this drama Though I love the innocence of Kayoung love. It should not be further insulted. I\\'ll detest that. I started out loving this drama.But its getting annoying because of the character of kang Sena and how Yoon Jung Han is kissing to her demand not to date Kayoung. From the look of things Sena is going to have her way all the time till towards the end. This would make it really annoyin. hope it is not as long as the mysterious personal shopper. I would just skip the episodes inbetween and wait till the end of the drama. Period! I\\'m loving this drama! The kiss cane early enough... it\\'s still early, so I\\'m ready for the makjang! It started interesting but now I lost interest. It\\'s too annoying to see the main girl follow the guy telling him she loves him and will wait for him over and over. Just gave do pride girl. He is not interested in you. Even if later he become interested in her it will come out of pity not real love. i love this drama.. kang eun tak i love your acting.. you\\'re such a great actor.. fighting.. Baek Jang Mi, isn\\'t she? Wow, Lee Young Ah, Glad to see her again... Definitely for Shim Ji-ho! Look forward to his outstanding acting as Kang Hyun-ki. @Liina, I agree that it\\'s rather sad that the always beautiful Hong Soo Ah decided to change her looks so unnecessarily, I\\'m quite certain that the same bubbly presence is still in there. She got some bad advice from somewhere, but I\\'m happy to see her return to the fold. As for Lee Young Ah, she is the reason that I\\'ll be watching this drama. Best of luck to all of us, cast, crew, and viewers alike. Omg I didn\\'t recognise hong soo ah she looks so different, so much surgery she used to have this sweet and innocent look and now she looks like wang bit na.. excited for this drama Lee young ah is a favourite actor of mine hope it\\'s good.. Shim Ji-ho will be in this drama, Ji-ho alone is enough for me to watch!! I miss her on Vampire Prosecutor aahhhhh >< I hope that the prime antagonist is very intensifying , and the prime protagonist is stronger Can\\'t wait for this upcoming drama series, u know what , I like dramas with female antagonist I hate male antagonist, bad one Love it',\n",

I haven't laugh this much over a dorama lately. It's been awhile that i've found a gem like this. Lol. This dorama is by far the funniest j-drama that I've seen this year. Thumbs up to Kubota-san for his excellent portrayal of his character here. Of course Kawaguchi-san like what I've said on my previous comments here, seems like she's getting gorgeous every time i'm seeing her on her new drama. And she's getting sexier and hotter too! Totally recommended to everyone! Yes, finally! Wow finally romcom for Masataka Kubota\",\n",

       "  'comments': 'Sungminnnnnnnn Another nice drama with rushed ending.... ??????? Enjoyed watching. Happy ending, will miss you. This was one of the best 2018 dramas. I don\\'t understand the low ratings. To all the cast and writers, you did really well. I am going to miss you. One of the best korea drama I have ever watch One of the best drama I\\'ve ever seen..it made me laugh and cry so hard..The actors are great..so love it..highly recommended??????? First drama where a guy screams so much. yeah, the rating is not important....but, the story...for me, this is one of the bests....though, it may seem simple, but, the ingredients are complete....keep up, all the actors portray their role well.... Lee Si Young is back.........Ji Hyun Woo is great....What a perfect drama....excited for all the episodes..... it is very fun enjoyable to watch. dont get distracted by rating This drama is soooo good...please make more dramas like this one. I hardly recommand it!!;3;3;3 this drama is so good good good This drama is very very good Lee see young IS the best but the leader actor looks very unkind his play seems fake i am watching for thé main actresse she is just only the best her smile and her glance are just top good when i watch her i feel really happy .she is so natural so i watch this drama for her she is one of favorites actresses I can\\'t get enough watching this repeatedly! This drama surely made all my hormones go up high as well! But the rating underestimated the perfectness of the drama brought! This is just so unjustifiable -_____-+ An excellent rom/com, its sad it has poor rating in Korea. It may be related to time slot, but a must watch if you like comedy romance and a little twist. This drama way too nice ... It\\'s like tom and jerry fighting between two leads.. now it\\'s getting more interesting after they confessed their feelings .... It\\'s totally different kdrama with diff concept .... Wth with ratings i will give 10/10 .. lee si young is totally different when compared her from playful kiss ... She is so cute there don\\'t know what happened but still her role is nice in this drama ... I\\'m waiting for next episodes. So badly... .. this drama making me heart pound ,?? I love this drama!! What’s wrong with the rating??? It\\'s really relay for tonight episode... More dramas/project for ji hyun woo jebaaal~? This ratings no good becouse astro can not up follow this drama oh k tv. Why.? I dont know. If this drama up follow to ASTRO n OHK channel this drama top ratings!! .. I LOVE THIS KOREAN DRAMA. FRESH FUNNY FUN ENJOY ..LOVE IT!!!??? Honestly, i love the story except for the lead actress. She\\'s so annoying. Her character is ruining the drama. What\\'s with it\\'s ratings? it\\'s so good, just why??!! I love and enjoying the drama, i miss Jang Dol Mok and Kang Soju love you JIHYUN WOO fighting????? can\\'t wait to next episode... I\\'m enjoying the show ^^ Can\\'t wait for the Next episode.. it is medical romance comedy genre....very very rare.... honestly the only reason why this is bearable to watch is because of Cross Gene\\'s Shin Won Ho lol I can\\'t watch this anymore. Its soo annoying. The lead actress is soo weak allowing everybody to trample on her. And the main guy is taking his anger out on everybody. Wen he made Dr joo in-A leave the hospital he was happy, but wen someone framed him and made him leave the hospital,he became angry and wanted yo know who framed him. He is not worthy of being a doctor, he hates everybody. Is he the first person to loose a friend? i really dont understand why this is getting low ratings @lizzy after HSJ accident he became really mean but the main reason why he is mean to JJA is because he thinks she is the girl that his dead friend liked because he saw a picture of her in his house. And that she rejected his friend telling him he had nothing to offer her.. and while his friend was heart broken and drunk he got on his bike saying that he was going to go to her and convince her that he was good enough for her...and he died on the way so he is mad cause she is living her life all good and smiley while his friend is dead. meanwhile she is not and i think she even had an unrequited love for his friend while his friend was in love with her half sister. and the sister is a fucking bitch, cause the HSJ\\'s dead friend took out a loan and bought the bitch sister a hand bag with the help of HSJ, and she ended up giving out the bag to JJA who wore it to an occasion now HSJ is already suspicious of her and the bag confirmed his suspicions because he recognised it...so yes its a misunderstanding but that is why he is mad..but he is now conflicted because her character is not that of a gold digger. SPOILER!!!!!! @lizzy He thinks she\\'s the cause for his friends death. His friend was saying he had to go see his girlfriend because he still loves her even though she broke up with him and said that he was useless. So he drove drunk to try and go see her. The lead actor is soon mean to her, someone should explain to me why he is soon angry, is she the cause of his friend\\'s death? or he once liked her or what? Cos I don\\'t really get it. If he doesn\\'t want a test, she should just let him be. But is there any illness like that? This drama is good and funny. Why lowest rating? Remind me to Wild Romance!! I like all Lee Si Young dramas!!! Medical Romantic Comedy type huh? i looove lee si young..been waiting for her drama after she gave birth...and am glad she choose this one i missed her so much i watched lookout over and over again while watching the border too....i look forward to this drama @LKB Hey there! I completely agree with your sentiment on how Shin is definitely ready for bigger roles. I also am confused, but at the same time am happy to see him onscreen again. (Excuse my tablet\\'s autocorrect tendencies below... Kim Jin Yeop not Help... Still trying to change it even when I manually tap Yeop...) I am a little baffled and a tiny bit disappointed that the second lead is Kim Jin Help not Shin Won Ho and not because of any special affinity for one or hate of the other, just a matter of who would logically be ready for a second lead role. With Shin Won Ho, he has been acting 7 years and played prominent roles before. I have noticed him from back in Big (superb show!) playing the youth who swaps spirits w/Gong Yoo, the hacker in Legend of the Blue Sea, the little bro to supermodel Sa Jin Jin in 20th Century Boy and Girl, and one of the circle of friends taking a bizarre animal yoga class together in Secret Message, probably his AND Yoo In Na\\'s most odd program (but idol fixated shows usually are a bit out there). He was even adorable and \"better than the script\"(and honestly better than the lead, Ji Chang Wook, who at the time could pull off cute but couldn\\'t really do much else to convey any depth, not that the bad script gave much opportunity to shine!) in the overall lame show Bachelor\\'s Vegetable Shop, his \\'real role\\' debut as far as I am aware. i like the story so different waiting for july!!!!!!!! Dang, who is that hot guys beside the female lead? I hope it will be booming. Super duper mega hitz gonna watch this drama just for the brilliant cast hope this is a different drama and lee si young back so i am gonna watch it for sure I get to know Ji Hyun Woo after watched him in Bad Thief Good Thief with Seohyun. I love his acting. I\\'ll definitely watch this drama along with Seohyun\\'s new drama. What a busy July. Can\\'t wait!! I could definitely see the chemistry between the actors when they were in \"Becoming A Billionaire\". oh my god lee si young with ji hym woo that would be a treat to watch hope its not a melodrama lee si young back quickly after marriage!!!!!! looking forward hope this will be a good drama waiting for this drama all the best si youngsshi Looking forward to Ji Hyun Woo’s drama. Hope it is a romantic comedy with some interesting stunts by Lee si young. cant wait to watch this drama because i love lee si young:-) very happy that both my fav actors as leads love them together lee si young is back so happy ooh love them I have watched becoming a billionaire old drama but a classic love oppa watched most of his drama and unni in lookout wow can\\'t wait fighting',\n",

       "  'comments': 'My second best drama ever along with Brilliant Legacy. The first drama that can make me cry. Hahaha.. This drama so funny & so sadden i love this drama Has to be my favorite drama of 2018! Loved the chemistry! This had me laughing and also in tears. The first episode really drew me in. Loved the second lead as well! Such a great cast and story. Binged watch this in a day!! Totally worth it. The leads have great chemistry and the supporting cast are hilarious + unique storyline. 100% recommended!!!!! Such a talented actress. I enjoyed watching this drama. The actors are amazing. Light story line but some heartbreaking moments (I did cry around the last 2 episodes). But generally, it made me smile a lot. Excellent chemistry I must say! It’s so boring that I had to watch it fast forward and I still had to skip so many parts. I am now on ep 8, but it’s time to quit this mess Absolutely loved this drama! If you are into action and crimes, this is NOT the drama for you. This drama was sooo sweet that I smiled for the whole day and the day after watching this drama. Also loved how classical music was one of the main focus of this drama since I love classical music as well. Not the best drama i\\'ve watched but really just one of those dramas that will make you smile if you haven\\'t for a while, this is a great time passer while waiting for a new drama. I did crave for some action drama after watching this due to the lack of intensity that i\\'m used to seeing in kdramas. 8.5/10 I love the story and the whole cast. I\\'m 36 and old but watching this story makes me feel young once again. I wish I can meet them and take photo with them. More power to your group! I love this drama. The story was amazing plus the casts were perfectly fit into this drama. Kudos to the production!!! I\\'m very satisfied and until now still hooked on to the story I thoroughly enjoyed this drama. I loved this drama because there were no back stabbing or revenge or murder just to get ahead. Shin Hyesun and Yang Sejong is such a loving and fragile couple in love. They should win Best Couple award. Ahn Hyo-Seop is such a great actor I will vote him as Best New Artists. Thank you script writer, director and producer for a heart warming drama. I like to see more of such drama dealing with human interactions. the 31 december in the SBS drama if these two Don\\'t win the best couple award i will stop watching drama their are so cute. SHIN HYE SUN is definitly become my fav actress she act so natural and she is so funny Yang Se jong Don\\'t impress me in temperature of love but now i\\'m a fan!secondary actors are also important here it\\'s impossible not to love them CHAN is so cute i almost ship with Seo Ri and jennifer is so touching anyway this show is one of the best of this years all of this cast deserve an award At the end that I quit this drama I could not stop crying I love them! I REALLY REALLY LOVE THIS DRAMA!! I really really love the story as in! @Chein I really like this show the actress and actors are excellent and The chemistry is daebak the couple is so cute I Hope this two will win the best couple award!! Really love this drama. Got many motivation about lyfe ❤ What phone did they have This was one of the best dramas iv seen. The story line is interesting in every episode but not too over empowering where there’s forced drama to keep it interesting. Absolutely one of the the best romcom dramas of 2018 and right up there with the best of all time imho. It has everything, super cute, super funny, super serious, super romantic and super sad at times it had me gripped from start to finish and I binged watched it over a couple of days as I just couldn\\'t stop once I started it! If you love K drama Romcoms then I can guarantee you will love this, so what are you waiting for? GO WATCH THIS NOW!! Light and heavy at the same time. No boring episode. I love both the lead actor and actress. I love this!! This is a really good and underrated drama imo I would give it a 8 out of 10, the whole concept and the characters are great in this! The dog and the chicken are supercute. Only thing that annoyed me was that the female lead got superwhiny in the last few episode, whereas for the character growth she should have gotten stronger and not weaker. Anyway, it is still very much worth watching, I\\'ve never seen a korean drama before which deals with such difficult subjects as accidents, being in coma and loosing time for one reason or other. Such a good drama. It made me laugh and cry What was amazing in this drama is how much the younger version resembled the older actors This drama really took my heart away. This drama teaches us so many things like helping a stranger, doing the things that will make us happy and not minding what others are doing. Doing the things we love without having to compete with others will just make us happy like what Seo Ri did. Also, we can see how the truck driver patiently waits for Seo Ri to wake up even tho it took her 13 years later to wake up. The family they created even though they are not related to each other made them all happier. Another one is that opportunities are everywhere in our lives we just have to look for it. I’m amazed by the lead actress’ acting, she really acts like an adolescent I give it to the cast off this drama I love them all expecially our chan i have to give this drama 9.5/10 for healing drama...sometime i tired of weak girl who refuse to growth on her own,just 100% depend on other especially the lead guy....and never say thanks enough for what they did for her...so here we can see that all the character were independent on their own even the side character but they way they always be aside with eachc others just make me felt so warm like how stranger can became family and complete each others Good plot but the actors didnt make it come alive. No chemistry between the leads and too much crying for stuff that didnt even need crying especially for a guy. Just put me off. It may have been better with different actors. I\\'d give it 9/10 because, honestly, it\\'s one of the few good dramas from this season (early Autumn). The story was certainly fit for reading in a good novel and the picture made it better. It\\'s the cutest, melodramatic, romantic drama you\\'ll ever find in 2018. Simply an easy watch because of its great actings, well presented story, and nice OSTs. It is almost perfect! Everyone is changing slowly to the extend that you may not realize yourself that their characters are developing, more and more lovable? This one really touches my heart. No dull moments at all. Characters, chemistry and story wise, it\\'s perfect! The back story and twists were great. I love how they treated each other as families. All of the characters were lovable despite their imperfections. Even Hyung Tae, Rin Kim and Seo Ri\\'s aunt. Two thumbs up for this drama. Highly recommended. I just finished watching this one and I love it sooooo much! Wow! Simple but excellently done kdrama.. It\\'sbeen really a while that there is a kdrama that made me addicted.. This made me glued to it.. So romantic, humour is at the right scenes and then the drama itself... Great great acting from both the two leads.. And kudos also to all the support, they did an excellent job.. The muaical scoring is so beautifully incorporated in every necessary scenes! It has no boring or dragging feeling.. The best of 2018 for me so far... Highly recommended! I love this drama, highly recommended, I love the story and how each characters portray their roles. This drama is just too amazing. This genre is light-hearted and cute. There are humors in it and the characters are all likeable. I loved every episode of this drama because the plot is very well written so everything makes sense. The story started it off well, however they don\\'t just stop the excitement there, they continue to unveil more and more things and they are interesting. This drama is romance based, but it\\'s not cheesy. The main leads are super cute together! I just love everything about this drama. 200% Recommended Perfectly written drama!!! Very heartwarming, I feel no anger when watch this drama, like no other mainstream drama. Must watch! Rating: 9.5/10 I really love it.... no boring moments from episode 1 to end. i really like the storyline... the characters and i love them. i am recommended this drama. two thumbs up!!! I like the story If anyone knows what brand the black sheer and ruffle sleeveless dress with constellation, stat and planet print that Seo Ri wears in ep 24 pr 25 please let me know! I want that dress! ( Plus I really liked the drama! And Seo Ri’s wardrobe!) A must watch drama! Worth your time! Super Highly recommended! ♡♡♡ Still 17 is one of the best dramas I have ever seen. The cast was excellent. The writing was excellent. The journey from the first episode to the last episode was filled with constantly growing and evolving characters and feelings, laughter, tears, more laughter, romance, familial love, friendship, kindness, joy and enlightenment. This drama gets the highest marks from me and the highest recommendation whether you have seen 0 dramas or 200 dramas. This drama is worth your time. i love this drama because it\\'s funny and heartwarming. They take the time to make sure the characters develop true deep meaningful relationships and though there were times I wished they deepened the relationships faster. I was always entertained and loved every minute and boy was that a satisfying and joyful show from beginning to end to watch. If you want something that will make you feel good and happy, this is the show if you understand that it\\'s a show about character character development. As this show said and personifies, when one door of happiness closes, it\\'s not the end if we are willing to be open and see that another door opened. I don\\'t think this drama is slow paced,I think it\\'s the opposite.Who would think drama is slow paced when u didn\\' know the \\'1 hr drama ep seems like a 5-min time only?I mean,u don\\'t notice the time cause you enjoy it so much.And besides,aren\\'t all dramas predictable these days?Unless u watch an action drama,there,u can find twist and u won\\'t predict what happens Every viewer has its own feels to avery kdrama. But for me, I don\\'t think it\\'s a slow paced drama. I mean, in every episode, i kept wanting for more, cried and laughed. the sequence of the story was good and the actors are great. I was a bit disappointed that the last episode seemed to have a lot of shortcuts. Like, the realizations of Yoo Chan that Seo Ri is not for him, the back story of Seo Ri\\'s Aunt, and of course their wedding scene which I really want to see. I mean, I still don\\'t want it to end. LOL @mr critic, I completely agree with you. This drama is good but very slow paced maybe that\\'s why I was forcing myself to watch it till the end even if I wasn\\'t that intrigued. It still is a warm drama that\\'ll make you feel fluffy on the inside:-P One of my favourites, really deserve the ratings. Fighting! ♡ this drama is great but this is slow pace drama. if you an inpatient watchers. i suggest don\\'t watch it.. when i start watching i already know it slow pace. i still kinda liked it... although it slow... I liked everything in this drama. story, characters, acting... cute... must watch... I really liked this one. It was very sweet, clean, as well as funny.:) It\\'s a amazing how every element of the show is perfect I kept laughing like crazy and crying at the same time till the very end even with the happy finale I cried saying goodbye much the same as if a dear friend was leaving it\\'s has been long time since i watched k drama that i really liked i waited for each episode eagerly i liked all the characters and all the actors and i\\'m happy that it was only 16 episodes I just feel so good about having watched this drama from beginning to end. I love the story and the back stories of the major characters. The casting is perfect which makes the drama so good to watch. Smart and different personalities of each characters are well thought and developed throughout the story. Writing is awesome and the dialogue plus the timing makes them so funny - like the 3 students, Jennifer and Seori and Woojin. Perfect scenes and background shots. Love watching this drama. Thank you for the beautiful kdrama....one of the best I\\'ve seen! This drama is amazing with unique charachters and they all are so lovely. I love the storyline, the characthers, and also all the crew they do a good job for making this drama. I like it because this drama shows me so many value of life but not in serious way and also show that every human is kind, its just out perseption that makes them an evil person. I’m starting to look for classicall music too >..< Im not hoping season 2 because many drama made it but it’s not as good as the first season It was good from the beginning till the end. If it was stretched it could have been dragged like secretary Kim and if rushed ended like marry me now. Both the shows were good but their pace was not consistent This kdrama took my whole heart. It was so simply made but each moment was precious. Mr Gong and Seo ri were both beautiful. Their love made my heart flutter. I will miss them so much. Although sbs didn’t give us the intended number of episodes (20), I’m still grateful for giving us a drama filled with soul. My mondays will feel so empty:( I tried to be happy with 32 episodes but I still think this could be at least 36 episode long because there’s some scene on trailer last 2 episodes that didn’t make to the final cut like when an older women said to Seori “Don’t hate them, you can resent me if you want” (something like that) and when Seori said she met her uncle. I mean, the next drama will air on 1st October which means the slot for this time on last week of September will be empty. I wonder how would they fill it. ihsan @ one of the best dramas ive ever watched! The cast was amazing an i loved the story <3 will miss this drama a lot:( Season 2???? This is the best drama i\\'ve ever seen in this year. I love se jong more than i expected. I hope se jong will get a new drama and i\\'ll watch! I have some fun time with this drama. What is the soundtrack for the last episode when Jennifer walks out of the house? It was only like 5 seconds of the background music Best . . 5star:) i never think they will cut the episodes, i like this drama so much, love all caracters. it\\'s a good story, i think the last episodes is next week I thought still 17 has 40 episodes. why 32 only??? What?! So the series was ended?! I\\'m so in love with this drama! I love everything about it, I love the storyline, I love the script, I love the clothes and of course I love all of the actors! I\\'m happy and at the same time sad because the drama already ends. I couldn\\'t wish any better ending! Thanks for provided such a great drama! Sarang-hea????? I haven\\'t watch K-Drama since Goblin..... i stumble this drama in Youtube where it shows some of the scene in the drama and also watch a few episode.... and boy i was not wrong!!! It is one of the great drama this year and the story was so cute and sweet.... hahaha..... since then, i start to watch from 1st episode and it reallt didn\\'t dissapoint me.... love the cute and innocent Seo-ri.... episode 29-30 really made me cry when Jennifer tears up and slap the guy who killed So-mi and Jennifer\\'s husband..... really tears me up.... TT..... Really love this drama since first episode until last episode last night. What a beautiful story with beautiful chemistry between woo jin and soo ri, they really good together and every romantic scene seems very natural. Good job for this drama. Thank you very much for the actors, the actresses, writer nim, the director, and all of the staff. The ending is very beautiful. Wait for sbs drama award this year.. Great job writer-nim...you always give good story with good ending. Nice drama. Wait they cut it from 40 then 36 and then 32 I followed this drama since 1st airing till the last episode which was last night (32 episodes) and i have been a korean dramas fan since 2004, i would say this was one of the best korean drama ever. @Arlene Songcaya Pujanes: I think Fang is Pomeranian (?) Only 32 episodes? Why?????? So amazed with chan character... I wish everyone in this world is kind hearted like him... What a nice world this can be... Please what is the breed of fang? This drama is reallly good because no evil character , give us moral value , such a positive character , they support each especially our \" Don\\'t Think , Feel!!\" Squaddd i quite disappointed sbs cut 4 eps?? love everythings about this drama , Mr Gong , Seori, Jennifer , Chan and Don\\'t Think Feel team!!? Episode 27-28 cry me a river T.T I decided to watch this dram because my favorite actress is cast as the aunt. Despite her limited, role I have enjoyed this drama immensely. My water works didn\\'t start until the very end of 14 when she says, \"His name was Gong Woo Jin.\" Those two short flashbacks at the end killed me. Those looks and smiles the young Seo Ri were directing at him just melted my heart. I was bawling my eyes out. I just finished watching ep 14 and Woow I never expected that she had a crush on him as well!! Also he is so handsome and romantic I\\'m really glad that I choose to watch this drama, it\\'s so amazing and everyone\\'s acting is so good, I recommend it to all of you How come last 8 eps left? Why did they change it into 36 episode only but before it was 40 episode,. Don\\'t do this please! pdnim, kamdongNim, jebal, Hajimayo! Please stick to 40eps that was originally stated first,. We really lobe this Drama,. We want more scene of Mr. Gong and Woo Seori together,. Jebal,.??? i really wonder why they decided to cut down the drama from original 20 episodes??? My Fav Drama This Year!! love how the plot is not over the top. Love how simple it is and love the characters as well. I never cried so much in one ep drama . Ep 14 so emotional and breaks my heart. I really love the actors here. Their acting are brilliant and absolutely the best in their generation. I wish to see more of them in beautiful drama. This one is my top 5 and I have watched roughly 200 titles. So good . Highly recommended. This drama is daebak. Ep14- brokes my heart, i cry a lot, specially when she\\'s reading the letter.it is my first time seeing yang se- jong acting.good job everyone for a nice drama. This is definitely the best drama of the year. Some people thought it was predictable drama, but it was not at all. It was true that this drama will be cut down to 36 episodes, because the Where Stars Land Drama will be premiered on October 01, 2018. That\\'s why this drama will only have 36 episodes instead of 40 episodes. Btw kudos to all the actresses and actors of this drama, also the director, producer, the writers even all of the staffs. So many things being unfolded in ep 27-28..so i guess this drama will only have 32 ep..no need to drag to maintain the good ratings..best drama of the year I really enjoy this drama, love the simplicity and the heartwarming feelings I get from it. Top notch cast, beautiful chemistry, endearing characters with good life lessons (Jennifer, the voice of wisdom). Overall, a show full of cuteness and heart. Can\\'t wait for nextweek... ????? Kudos to the scriptwriter. I so love the lines of Woo Jin in Episode 28. So heartwrenching. One cant help feel the emotion within. It made me cry. very good drama omg i try so hard not crynnnnn I feel bad for Kim Hyung Tae, he wait and care for her for years but still seiri choose mr.gong. I guess it is not woo jin fault that seo ri stay on the bus. She migjt actually know the stop, it just she wanted to chat with him since she had crush on him... they shortened the episode.. why????? this drama is totally a hit!!!!! I knew she was in love with him first....wahh cried a river watching that episode....kyaaaaaa...plot twist am.loving it.. Omg ep 26 make me sad, many fact finally revealed. And kim hyung tae, omg i want to have a friend like him, and for me if i have friend like him i will to choose him to my future husband T.T . How could he still loved wooseori for years and not interested with another woman. Yang se jong?? I thought it had 40 eps??? Nooooo I need more:( I don’t care if it’s just an hour of them holding hands. I Don\\'t Care!!! Give Me More Eps!!!! I Will Watch Them. Was it really cut down to 32?Hmpp..I don\\'t so...no news whatsover.Besides,a lot of things that need to unfold,and most importantly,this drama is receiving great ratings,always ranked 1 of all the weekday evening dramas shown on the time timeslot VERY GOOD CHEMISTRY!!! The story was amazing. Always excited every episode!!! Best rom com drama so far! Mr. Gong and soo ri hwatinggg! He jussstt Found outtt that she was that girlllllll, omggggggg, finaly, i can\\'t waaaait tooo seeee I wonder why it was cut down to 16 episodes instead of 20 (32 instead of 40) Asdfghjkll Oh mah gawd 3!!!!!! KISSESS!!!!! This series is so heartwarming. I\\'m a bit conflicted on the love story coz i\\' not sure if i\\'m ok abt a 30-yr old and a woman with the experience of a 17-yr old? Does it not seem like a 30yr old and a 17-yr old being a couple? the last part of ep 24 was so sweet, we got three kisses in one ep I can\\'t be happier. I just feel bad for Kim hyung tae, he\\'s been there for 13years to woo seo ri and in the end we know Gong woojin got her??? And he still havent met seori till ep 24 #justiceforkimhyungtae I love the cast sooo muchh.. uwuuuuy i love ep 23-24 soo freaking adorable. now it\\'s exciting to watch it. They finally kissed and that too three times in total Ep23-24...so sweet, I even keep on rewind the last scene. hahaha what did you do with your life mr Gong? Never kiss anyone before? Last night episode really sweet... another week with one episode, I regret starting this drama before it ends (don\\'t get me wrong this drama is sooo good but one ep is not enough). Omg that \"once more\" kiss... My goodness finally they\\'ve kissed why this drama running so slowly? pls do a kiss scene This drama is wonderful if anyone is hesitating weather to watch it or not plz give it a try.The acting of male and female lead is aewsom.His smile is so heart warming and character of female lead is also good.The realtion between male lead and his nepkew(Chan) is worth watching.Simply this drama is heart warming.It has Love story,Bromance,Friendship and Comedy also.So give it a try Keep in mind that this is 17years old in Korean age, so technically she\\'s either 15 turning 16 or is already 16. (the age you are turning that year + one = korean age) @puja I think its a long-haired chihuahua What is the breed of dok ku? Thanks I love this drama! The storyline is so warm and I like how mr. Gong started to accept his feelings for her. But one thing bothered me is that seo ri seems so fine eventhough she have been trough coma for years, I know she got a couple of treatment in ep 1-2 but I didn’t think its enough. Isn’t her body got weaker because she’s just laying on the bed for 13 years? @yuri,I don\\'t think the female lead acts like a 12 yr old girl.When I was 12,all I could think was just to play and to have fun.Can a 12 yr old be nervous,excited and emotional when her crush is around?Can a 12 yr old think of living alone and be independent?She acts a teenager in this drama which justifies her actions knowing the fact she was in a coma for 13 yrs.And I don\\'tt think she acts like a teen at all,she acts mature in this drama,she\\'s responsible,loving and cheerful,only that she has has a heart of a child,sweet and innocent and loving. so ep 21-22 will be aired next week??is it only 2eps per week:( I loved this couple, I really loved their acting OMG I like this drama as a whole but is has one flaw i dont think 17 year olds act how it is portreyed in this drama. The way the female lead acts is more like a 12 year old im 16 and i don\\'t act like that. Even the child actors look like they are in the middle school not like highschoolers. I get that they tried making her innocent and stuff but people who are 17 are mature for the most part. It would have been better if they portreyed her as she went in a coma when she was 12 or something that would have made more sense waiting a whole week for one episode makes me so angry! i won\\'t watch it cuz of this. 1 ep isn\\'t enough at ALL! Aghhhh nothing happened much in ep 17, 18. I hope this drama would progress already and answer the big questions we\\'ve all been waiting for: @ANA one episode is not enough sbs, the drama is so good but waiting for one ep per week makes me angry. Couldn\\'t they have planned the asian games at an earlier or later timeslot? Feels really miserable to wait one whole week for just one episode:( I really love this drama. I like the casts, plots and story lines. Why they delay airing???????SBS pls give the reason Dang , waiting is torturing.... i miss Paeng / Deok Koo.... OMG . I\\'m totally excited to know what happen next. Andddddd bammm it wass delayed. Howw shittt. This drama is one of the reasons why I sleep in the wee hours of the night. I want to make sure I will not miss an episode. Am definitely hooked with the storyline, the chemistry and the cast. One of the best dramas of 2018, so far. Sbs, please do not delay any episode in the upcoming weeks. Waiting is a challenge! SBS I am gonna sue you ,How could you delay the airing for two weeks ,How dare you ,one episode per week is not enough??????? I am Watching still 17 Right now and he is so talented and cute I love this story...but can I ship chan with ahjumma more? I hope they can develop good relationship after the filming. I love this drama so much... I really like this kind of I laughed hard with this drama. The Leads are oozing with undeniable chemistry with their cute facial expression and innocence. This drama gives me a good vibe every time I watch it. It makes me smile at a moment whenever I think about it. My God, I can\\'t wait for another week for this drama to air. I am excited about the part where Mr. Gong will realize that Woo Seo Ri is his first love. I think i am in love with Mr Gong. At the start of the drama, i didnt know I would fall in love so hard with him. cast: cute doggo. ok I\\'m sold I love how similar yoon chang young and yang se jong look! I keep seeing yoon chang young in him! And vice versa. Their eyes. Their smile. Sometimes I dont like asian games because of this drama. T_T its my first time to watch yang se jong\\'s drama. he is good and cute:) Argh, I need ep 19-20 nowwwww Recommended for every romance drama fans. Yang sejong so cute. I like him in this project. Im fans of yang se jong because of this drama! I reallyyy love this drama , so sweet? I love the storyline so much mainly bc I’m a sucker for these types of dramas hehe plus the actors and actresses are doing great down to the support roles I love them all! Yang Se Jong’s expressions are so cute like I replay every scene to watch his reactions hahahahaha I know that in the end seo ri will end up with woo jin. But i can\\'t help to fallin in love more with Yoo Chan. I like him more than Woo Jin:\\') what should i do lmao the beginning of this drama was interesting but it’s starting to get boring and draggy. Good drama to watch. Both actors are doing great in their role. Can\\'t wait to see the next episode. Im really in love with this drama..im watching this because of Shin Hyesun but im really hooked with the storyline..and this is the first time I\\'ve watched Yang Sejong in a drama..im definitely a fan now..im not so into rom com drama because I thought it would be cringy and cheesy but im wrong..this drama really gives me all the feels watching it..sometimes it reminds me when im 17years old back then when I watched Seori,reminds me of my first love when I watched Chan..this drama really is great.. Shin Hye Sun unnie saranghye. Anywhere you\\'re I\\'ll always cheer on you PS you\\'re my mum\\'s favorite she\\'s a huge fan. Wishing u the best fighting!!!!!!!!! This drama so good..so many mysteries..like what happen to jenifer in the past( look like she was pregnant). Where the hell is seo ri uncle and aunty..woo jin first love and endless guilty..chan secret feeling..mystery guy who always visit and pay for seo ri hospital bill..and so on..lol Seo wo ri is 30 yrs but acts like a 17 yr old girl.For some who have not watched the drama yet,some will think she\\'s childish or immature.Nope,it\\'s far from it.She acts so mature and responsible in this drama.She thought about her own problems too.However,she acts with charm,cuteness on it and,pure,innocent and kind heart like a heart of child.That makes this drama special.It will keep you smiling throughout the drama.Plus the super duper handsome mr bong...First time to watch him in a drama.Never thought he could be this good....Then the cute nephew....chan....they deliver the drama in a lovely way,although the plot seems so simple and common,each 1 hr ep seems like a 5 min ep....u cant get enough.....argh excited for next week... .. Yoo chan is so freaking adorable!! xD Im in love with yang se jongg ❤️ I really like this drama I will watch this despite YSJ. I guess he\\'s now typecast to be the negative type guy who gets the girl in the end. I still can\\'t watch episode 15-16,still not on the net... Normally the drama will be upload early in the morning but until now in the afternoon still not upload. Gosh.. Can\\'t wait to know what happens. Ep. 15-16 so amazing...love shin hye sun, yang se jong and all cast...(clap 3x ) wow!!! this ep make me more laugh but teary too...can\\'t wait for next ep.. I LOVE THIS DRAMA. It is the very best drama of the year. It receives only good comments from viewers. I don\\'t like violent character which I think there will not be any. Bravo to all the team for delivering such a great drama, great actors, great plot. Thank you for allowing us to watch free, for those people who worked very hard to put the English subtitle as soon as it came out. You will find happiness here in this drama, especially episode 8 (or 16). I can guarantee even those who are very picky will adore this drama. I just don\\'t want to keep it to myself and would like to share it. i love this drama so much, and i\\'m gonna follow this drama until the ending, still 17/ thirty but seventeen fighting!!! I\\'m so hooked in this drama. It\\'s fun, new and so light. Plus Se Jong really looks like my baby Onew. More reason to watch..:D I love this drama so much so far! It’s so warm, cozy and fun and it really makes me laugh and cry. Seriously, It just makes me so happy and it’s been a long while since I could say that about a kdrama. Everyone is doing such a good job in their roles, especially the 3 main leads. So good! I see. the dog is more popular than me The best drama that I watched this year. Best actors and best actress. Fighting!!! Im glad Hyesun eonni got this role, she deserves the best. Love her so much x Yang se jong is so good at teary scenes, i wonder if in the future he take the melodrama role This drama is so, so wonderful and I\\'m only on the sixth episode - the acting, chemistry, comedy, characters, plot. I\\'m so fascinated by what will happen, and the otp are the cutest. He\\'s slowly starting to like her, he almost kissed her at the end, don\\'t know what will happen if he finds out she\\'s his crush After because this is my first life, i found a new love in monday-tuesday slot. Yes this is super awesome current drama no doubt Shs is really good on teary scene i love her? I wonder who is Jennifer, what kind of relationship will happen cause I\\'m thinking it because of the thing in her room. And what will happen with kim hyeong tae hmmm I\\'d like to see more exposures of Kim Hyeong Tae. I barely see him in every episode when it\\'s him who is constantly visiting and taking care of Woo Seo Ri when she was is a coma. I believe he deserve to have more screen time? All casts are great..even a dog acting on point.that dog deserve an award!!.plot developing so well..i like funny and light plot drama..hope this drama become a hit..shin hye sun is undoubtedly new top halyu actress!! I can\\'t wait for yang se jong to realise that she is his first love and reunite with her after many years. He is beginning to even have feelings for her without knowing she is his long time crush They put Deok Gu/Fang as the cast tho? Best Drama Ever. I can\\'t for ep.11 This drama is so good it\\'s simple yet funny, I love everything about it! I recommend you to watch it!! second drama after \\'My Golden Life\\', seeing Shin Hye-Sun acting. she was a good actress. in my golden life, her character a bit mature & serious, suitable for her age while still 17, she carry the character of 30 years old young women but have the mentality of 17 years old teenager such as, cheerful, funny, innocence, naive personality and sometimes cute too. hahaha. i must say, she is really good carrying that character. by the way, i liked the sidekick character of Jennifer, your house helper. English influenced & Mrs. know it all things. hahaha I really love this drama especially when Yang Se Jong play. I love all the cast and the story line. Hopefully it will a happy ending drama I love how this shows ties together that Seo Ri was in a coma for 13 years, but in a way so was Woo Jin. His wasn\\'t so much a coma, but a prison of guilt. He shut everyone out and stopped maturing as a person emotionally. So they really are emotionally at the same age as well as the same physical age right now. I love this drama so much for its heart and humor as well as great life lessons. Plus I\\'m learning so many quotes thanks to Jennifer Poppins. You\\'ll know what I mean if you treat yourself to this wonderful show. I wonder why ahn hyo seop agreed to become yang se Jong\\'s nephew as the second lead instead of acting with Kim too Jung as the main lead. Yang se jong and ahn hyo seop should be of the same age or so Yang Sejong acting never failed to impress me. His smile is to die for! That\\'s why he is one of my favorites. Shin Hye Sun is a great actress too but is it just me that didn\\'t feel any chemistry between them (yet)? I think Chan and Ahjumma are more compatible compare to Poop Ahjussi and Seo Ri Among the dramas that were also showing recently and those that were released the same time as Still 17, this is by far the best. It\\'s so refreshing to see an actor like Shin Hye Sun who is not the aegyo type but a really talented actress (watch her in Stranger, a totally different character but she\\'s excellent in it). I love her character here, so relatable and likeable! Even though the plot may have been cliche\\' already, it\\'s still interesting and every episode is something to look forward to. Btw, love the love square there... others might not agree with me, but I\\'m so excited with the chemistry between Chan and Seo Ri.. Poop Ahjussi, still waiting for that spark..maybe on later episodes.. With Doc, i think it\\'s gonna be heartbreaking... Lastly, Jennifer is the best <3 I wonder about jennifer;\\'D I\\'m watching this because of Shin Hye Sun..she was also in the drama She Was Pretty the same writer of this drama..loved her in My Golden Life and Stranger..she really nailed every character she was given..im loving this drama where it is heartwarming drama..and I love that all of them have a great chemistry..Chan,Mr Gong and Weori.. I thought i am not going to enjoy this drama but i was wrong! This drama is soooooo gooood! I am not a fan of Shin Hye-Sun and Yang Se Jeong but their chemistry got my attention! Sometimes its not really about who would be the actor and actresses will portray the role but also the chemistry they have! I guess, chemistry is the most important.. just saying.. This is the best drama! highly recommended if you like Rom/Com The story is refreshing I had no expectation for the drama at first but now im hooked because its soooooooo good! I have been patiently waiting for this drama to air 2 months prior. While binge watching episode 1, I constantly knew like this would be my all time favorite! Not only are the main casts great at their roles, but the plot was exceptional, I laugh and cry as the plot takes me. Now I\\'m hooked on this, better news for me is this drama will not end until its 40th episode. Awesome-sauce!!! Honestly though! That dog is so good! I don\\'t know why the ratings here are so low because anyone who actually has watched this show finds it to be heartwarming and funny. Are there bizarre bots out there trying to push this show down or people who are just basing their ratings on the description vs actually watching the first two episodes (actually four 35min)? The overwhelming majority of people love this show because it\\'s so rare nowadays to find such a warm and relaxing yet interesting and funny show to watch where the whole entire family can love. It\\'s the best show I\\'ve seen in years since Master\\'s Sun in terms of humor and heart. I really like this drama, nice story and the actors are great. I love the plot. I just want to laugh seeing that dog Deok Koo is enlisted here xD what a cute thing to do I really really like this drama??? This drama is amazing!!! Very funny, the accident scene is amazing, the acting skill of SHS is so amzing. Shin Hye Sun can pull out my deep feeling, I cry then laugh and then laugh then cry ... so amazing. SHS\\'s acting is so natural, I can\\'t stop loving her. Love it! Love it! Love Itt!! And we have 20 episodes! Fighting! The writer of this drama is same writer of she was pretty.No wonder.I got dejavu feeling.When I was reading the plot of that drama,(she was pretty),I found it flat and boring.Same goes with this drama.Simple plot,nothing special.But oh my! how can they make it so extraordinary with a simple plot. I don\\'t know but there\\'s something about this drama that gives me happiness and excitement at the same time..The female lead is just.....a gem!I started to like her in her drama,my golden life,with thatdrama drama.She became my favorite actress,beating song hye gyo and kim tae hee and jun ji hyun,who have always been my favorite actress.Hahah!ps.first time to like the male lead.I ddint like him in temperature of love nor all of his dramas,but here,he\\'s so hot!!!or maybe i\\'m being biased because he\\'s being paired with shin hye sun.Haha.Anyway,first two eps are nice,cool and lovable!! The plot is fresh and smooth! I loveeeeeeee this? Wooow ahnhyoseop face so different in this drama. Very uncomfortable look his face. Why his face change? He get plastic surgery or because diet and make his face totally different from latest drama I ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ this show! It\\'s one of those rare heartwarming funny shows that is so enjoyable to watch that you can watch it again and again. There\\'s not one character in this show that isn\\'t interesting or funny. It funny and silly while still being a smart, well-written show. The acting is great as well. Shin Hye Sun is hilarious and I think this will make her a huge star. I just randomly started watching the first episode o this drama and i was totally hooked up. This drama is so good. I just regret watching the first two episode before they complete airing because i have to wait every week for each episode . Anyway this will.be my next favorite after come and hug me ended This drama is so so so so good, a true surprise. Idk something about it makes it very special. The actors are not the most famous but they are amazing, I love new faces. The story is original but not super unrealistic, its cute, really funny (especialy thanks to PHS, she is such a good actress, she can make me cry and then make me laugh) touching and mysterious. I can\\'t for the next episodes. I think its gonna be one of my top 5 drama of the year. ♡♡♡ Drama is so much better than I thought Daebaaaak!!! I found cloning from on jung sun and sung joon here!!! really love this drama, especially with the presence Yang Se Jong as the main actor ... His acting is daebak.. the story is light and really interesting.. can\\'t wait for the next episode... Yang se Jong\\'s drama is always great... OMG in episode one when he sat on her choco pie...her reaction killed loooool me.. i just really really love shin hye sun Seems promising drama. I like romance comedy. This one can make me laugh in the first episode This drama looks promising! Dont let me down okayyyy OMG! The dog... cute! second episode very good and now with the eternal lover to wait the next week, what despair. I love this drama. Its fresh. And even Duk Goo is in that cast picture. Lol~ I loooovvvvveeeee this drama. It is so exciting.....looking forward to the next episode Don\\'t believe the score at the top on any drama you search for on here. Most of them are pumped up due to koreaboo virgin kids, that are just obsessed with the actors even if the drama is total trash. I was anxious for the opening date and I loved it well for the protagonists. just saw the first episode! i wasn’t planning to a start this but the cast and plot made me do it. so far, it’s a real nice light watch. i hope it continues to be good (: ??? Love that the little dog has a starring role. Hope to see a link with more info on this cutie? This plot is interesting!!! I think both main characters are somehow connected in the past. Saw the official poster, hope this gonna be alright The dog\\'s face though lol Weird her mental age is 17 yet she\\'s acting like she\\'s 10?? Makers better sort it out! Patiently waiting for this drama to air. The storyline seems interesting and I love both the lead actors. She finally had long hair.. i always see her in short hair.. Fantastic director across many genres and a good writer who improves steadily as She Was Pretty showed (especially good in comedic works which this NEEDS some of since otherwise the whole title-plot and synopsis could get too sad, too heavy)... I don\\'t like the fact that Shin Hye sun will play the part of a 30 year-old with a mind of a teenager... but that\\'s ok i have no life so i guess i\\'ll watch this drama with a misleading plot! Yang Se-Jong and Shin Hye Sun, are my best favorite. I cannot dream more perfect association. A lot of expectations for this drama. One thing I can be sure that whatever plot as they deliver sincerity in their acting, the drama will be saved. I like all the dramas of Se-Jong, dark role or romantic and sensitive. Amazing actor! Shin Hye Sun was very good in second role (Forever Young, Five enough), and the last main role in My Golden LIfe was just superb. excited for this upcoming Drama of Se Jong.. Daebak!! I was browsing about Yang SeJong and I found out about this. Omo a collab between HyeSun and SeJong is da bomb! Both are doing great in dramas I guess many will expect this to have high ratings. Hwaiting! Actors are great, but the plot just sounds terrible. Too sad, hope to see Seo Eun Su in female lead. Ok.. breathe it calmly.. yess Yang Se Jong and Shin Hye Sun is coming togther in a Kdrama ( pinched myself)!! Yay yay ...Daebakkk .. So muchhhhhh excited to see my two fave actors in a Kdrama together, it\\'s an first female lead role for Shin Hye Sun in mini series! Am i correct? So excited to watch it. SHS and YSJ is already confirmed for the drama yayyyyy i cant wait for July sksksk are still SHS and YSJ take the role this drama? if its yes, def I\\'ll be watching. I thought Shin Hye Sun had really funny scenes in She was Pretty, the writer for 30 but 17\\'s last show. That outhouse scene with SHS was hilarious. Though they wrote her character to be a mini antagonist, after that scene, she started to grow on me. Once I saw SHS in Five is Enough then went back to watch She was Pretty, I appreciated that character and SHS\\'s comedic timing even more. omg i hope they both accept yess! i hope shin hyesun & yang sejong will get to work together! really looking forward to their next work following temperature of love & my golden life! woaaah YSJ ♥ and now here I am hoping Seo Eun-su will be the female lead? Though i originally hoped the starring drama Moon Chae-Won. I would love to see Moon Chae-Won choose the romantic comedy genre as the next project. but.. maybe i should be more patient waiting for her comeback:\\') I am curious about whether YSJ in particular will take this role-the writers he worked with so far were better than the so-so one for this... I hope this writer has improved a lot-SWP certainly showed improvement over prior works but the director has usually had much better success than the writer (objective and subjective ie better ratings And to me better quality)... SHS only has the little 2-ep TV movie w/LJS on her plate right now but she is in high demand after My Golden Life+LotBS... I hope the writing is solid. If it is, the actors will soar. If not, it will weigh them down. Yang se jong with kim ji won please',\n",

       "  'comments': 'I\\'m gonna watch this It\\'s an amazing paragraph designed for all the web viewers; they will obtain benefit from it I am sure. Hi guys, Cheon suho??? these drama is so good that every time I watch it I cry a lot. this drama affect me a lot only even if I watch short scenes in YouTube. Every time I watch that I cry my heart out. great job from all the staff. And the leads are perfect I love them. hope to see them soon. I love this drama.. Make me cried a lot.., make me hurt... First time commenting, but I just had to. I hesitated watching this because I know my guy was not able to complete it, but boy what an injustice I would have committed. So glad, I decided to tune in. My guy was superfluous as usual, but I was very surprised by the rest of the cast. just stellar performances from all members. superb writing, directing and editing. well done. And I just discover my new favorite song, \"the end of the world.\" I watched this drama recently after learning it was the same writer as Secret and Mask. I didn\\'t know he had released a new drama. In fact, I wasn\\'t even aware of this drama as it was airing. I binged watched it in 5 days and now I feel hallow... Never saw anything before of Kim Junghyun or Seohyun but they blew my mind here. I did not expect the change in their characters at all. Cheon Suho was disgusting, but then he became a man of honor. Seol Jihyun was a typical poor and weak protaganist, but she became so powerful and clever. The love story hurts so much because it is unlike any other drama. The character\\'s feelings not only grew painfully and naturally, they became confidantes and real partners who understood each other\\'s souls. Everything was ripped away in the most tragic circumstances. The story is haunting and makes me reflect on my own life and loved ones. The writing is fast and jerks you around, but it is never shallow or trite. Performance and writing aside, the cinematography and music are top notch. It\\'s rare to see this level of quality and chemistry. Definitely one of the best and most underrated dramas of the year. I stopped watching it when they said that Kim Jung-Hyun drops out of drama..But continued watching it again at Episode 15 today and end up crying a bucket..Its really a very sad story but the story for me was hands down..the actors did a great job..It was underrated!!!! I cant believe it received low rating in Korea..the drama deserve an award..Kim Jung Hyun never failed to amazed me with his acting until his last scene, praying for his good health. I\\'ve cried a lot w/ ds drama...specialy for the lead man...kim junh hyun Oppa ur such a great actor..he deserve an award for this his acting is so effective even he is suffering from illness in a real life. I was hesitant to watch it since I knew it will be heavy drama and the leading man had to leave the show early but I can\\'t stop myself watching him. I\\'m on Ep 5 (Ep 9-10) and though the end of the episode was a hopeful one, I still felt so sad for the lead couple for all the pain they still will go through. I have to brace my heart for all these pain until the last episode. TT If time/shigan has part 2 probably jihyun will find her happiness. have a happy family, not alone anymore. also maybe her husband is suho look alike the best drama...this drama make me can\\'t sleep because usually i\\'m watching after the drama finished, many different emotions u can feel in every eps..i love seol ji-hyun character, she is very brave woman..seohyun did a very good job..not only seohyun, the all actors (especially KJH) and staffs did an amazing jobs..congratulations and thanks for giving us a great drama... Such a beautiful drama, but such a SAD one! Thank you MBC for giving us a great time in watching TIME. We hope to see KJH & Seohyun together in the near future drama! ❤️ Wow and here I thought mask was good, this is even better and yes the show ended for me when Cheon Soo-Ho\\tdied. I wanted him to return at the end but not everything you want you get. He made the show best for me. Seol Ji-Hyun tired a lot too, I like a strong woman. She did really better in this drama. Wow I was trailed with the part where they couldn\\'t trust each other. Seol Ji-Hyun really did play here part. Shin Min-Seok was amazing though you couldn\\'t tell what was thinking or what he would do next. I love this show. It deserves a lot of awards. Thanks guys. Finally this drama has come to an end. Do you know where the place when seol ji hyun reveal the truth, at ep 30? What is the building? shigan team, they are so amazing!!! the actors, the staffs, they did really well in this drama. this drama makes me cry, but i still love it. i love \"time\" so much. their acting, chemistry, storyline, cinematography and ost are all great. junghyun oppa get well soon. seohyun unnie stay healthy, your acting so amazing. i really love cheonseol. i hope i can see cheonseol once again in one project. will miss you two on another drama. kim junghyun and seohyun deserve an awards for their acting. their acting really amazing. cheonseol chemistry is really good just looking in each other even without skinship. all of actors and staffs already work hard.. shigan is the best!!!! Such a beautiful drama.. with a great meaning of life... i\\'m glad that i stayed till the end... everything is perfect.. from the cast, ost, beautiful scenery. This is best drama for me. What...That\\'s it...Was I the only one waiting for \"him\" to come out....I\\'m crying...I feel bad for ji-hyun...She should at least be happy:( it\\'s the best drama i ever saw so realistic beautiful and meaninful drama If y’all seen the amazing Jay Chou’s movie Secret. Y’all heard his piano piece being played by our beautiful leads. I was shook! Shigan is checked off my drama list, damn was this drama painful to watch till the end. I still miss KJH/CSH. Best and best drama ever I really admire seol jihyun. He just died.. like that!? Well, I think Ji Hyun has planned everything, even Soo Ho death could be fake. I wanna see him in last episode even for 3 or 5 seconds. this show get more interesting. I love thriller part! What will happen to Seol Ji-Hyeon? I guess there\\'s a twist in this story...I dnt think he died..perhaps he went to USA for treatment. He\\'ll be back in the last 2 episodes?? So after this no more soo ho what will happen to jihyun?? lmao they really wrote him off in the lamest way possible this drama doesn\\'t feel the same without jung hyun I can see the sadness of Soo-Ho\\'s turtle where he always witnesses how painful the life of the person who cares for him is when the people around him are too concerned to solve problems and fulfill their ambitions. My drama. Its really make me want to keep up with this drama. Its so twisted.. My first drama give me different view. Both main actor and actress i give 5 star. Hope a good ending for them even both of the character is dead. If there is a lot more promotion in beginning this i called drama in movie will be hit. Gud Luck for this drama love youu seohyun my fav. Applause to seoljihyun. my brave woman @Trexie Ann — Soo Ho dies sooner because the actor is leaving the show due to illness. Omg this is the best drama ever!! Its make cried angry so much in every episode!! I feel bad for both so hoo and ji hyun!! They deserved to be happy.. because from the start they suffered alot.. hope pdnim can give them a happy ending!! Or atleast some romantic scene please make them confess their love.. all i can say wowwww kim jung hyun is really good actor!! Indeed!! I love he played the matured character instead of school boy .. he look so attractive in this drama ❤️❤️❤️ Even sad that he left the drama because of his health issue but i Hope he will recover soon his health more important.. please cameback with best condition and hope in future jung hyun can paired again with seohyun eith different concept .. and seohyun just make me wow!! Tbh i not really interested in her previous drama because she look awkward but now she so good!! Her acting look natural!! Lastly still hoping for happy ending and some romantic scene between them ❤️❤️ Time is an amazing drama! Haven’t watched a drama that makes me angry and frustrated in awhile. Totally recommended and the OST’s are amazing, can’t wait till they release bgm’s. I honestly am amaze with KJH! He portrayed SH so freaken well with his emotions and his expressions. I just want to reach out and hug him. I look forward to his acting career after he is healthy and well. We, as your fans will wait patiently. Can you please don\\'t let Sooho die? I mean I\\'m not ready to see Sooho die, been watching and following this drama and I was hoping to have a happy ending. Please please just make it a happy ending. I want to see both Jihyun and Sooho be happy even in the last episode. They deserve to be happy too and they had enough pain and agony. Hoping!!!!! I love seoljihyun 2.0 but I miss pure seol jihyun I like Kim Jung Hyun since in Waikiki. It\\'s really bad if he quit in the middle of drama. i m really happy to see this drama ...actually it is one of the best drama i was really excited to see the ep ... the actors are awesome....i actually cried a lot ...and it really makes me happy minseok jihyun has more beautiful memories together than suho jihyun. they have more beautiful past photo together because of their 6 years relationship. Time is actually a very good drama. It really hold you tight to your seats...wondering what will happen next. A ltlle bit dramatic but never boring. The 2 lead casts are amazing...you might not like kim jung hyun’s character initially but after some time....after a few episodes, his character grows on you... Amazingly when i watched ep 20s above, his acts are convincing & amazing. Sohyun too did really well... i watched this drama so far bcos of the 2 leads, the plot & the other great casts. The ost too is nice. What a total let down when kjh had to leave the drama bcos of health condition. We hope he will be better & be able to resolve the problems. As for this drama, the casts, director & producer....pls make good of it with the remaining episodes. I will watch this to the end...Let the remaning episodes be better & not fizzle out. Let the ending be a good one. I truly hope this drama will do well....fighting...fighting... I cried so hard in the last two episodes when Ji Hyun\\'s getting her revenge. I cried especially hard when she suggested that they adopt the little boy from the orphanage and you could tell deep within Sooho\\'s eyes that that\\'s what he wants. He wants to be a father and to have kids and to live but he know that he can\\'t and I just started crying because I already know how this is gonna end. I knew they were gonna kill his character but I still wasn\\'t prepared for it. I just feel so sad that he still has so many things he wants to do but hasn\\'t done yet. My heart is breaking for him. Yaaaa! R u kidding me..why didnt they include cheon soho in ep25 26 preview?? Ofcourse we know that he isn\\'t gonna die but atleast we should see reaction of seoljihyun and him in hospital atleast...we all are rooting sooho and jihyun to death...i hope atleast from ep14, some kind of chemistry happens between them. Otherwise its a waste of emotions and time. i watched this drama because of seohyun, but after watched the drama i fall in love with all the team. the PD who can lead the actors greatly, the writer who can make the viewers drowning in the story, the four lead actors who can delivered the character really alive, the staffs who work hard. with many controversy from the start, low rating, KJH sickness, i will support the drama till the end because i never found this kind of masterpiece drama before \"TIME\". i hope KJH and Seohyun will got another chance to act together but with light and happy ending because i love their chemistry ^_^ seol jihyun and shin min seok actually has a great chemistry, he still has feelings for her, unfortunately he became the murder of her mom because he was in the car with the person he wants to kill. His weakness is still seol jihyun. I think Shin Minseok can kill everyone except seol jihyun 23-24?????????? se hooo dont leaveee Wow ep23/24 is emotional. I cried and got upset at the drama secret, loved mask but this is all new and really emotional and intense. Soo-Ho (Kim Jung-Hyun) is an amazing actor and he deserves the credits. I hope to see him soon in other dramas. I just luv him. I keep on watching this drama just to know how the team will take out Soo Ho\\'s character. And it is so heart-breaking. so, just watching for the trailer of ep 25-26 and didnt see soo ho anymore??? that means kim jung hyun already dropped out from this serial??? Someone please make Cheonseol drunk so they can say \"i love you\" to each other please jebal putaktirimnidaaaaa!!!!! Can tell me what the song played ini episode 23 cry me a river Just watched the 23 & 24th episode, I wish they didn\\'t write out So Hoo\\'s character like that, because that will broke my heart. i think kim junghyun acting is good..his emo is heart-felt.they can shorten the number of episodes since he is leaving i dont care about the storyline of the drama, I am watching because of kim jung-hyun.he is really good in portraying his character.absolutely stunning. ep 23-24 make me cry... i wish So Hoo has an happy ending with his life... somehow i feel like watching Uncontrollably Fond in more tragic story... I cried a river watching ep 12, I am not wishing for a happy ending but I just want him to be happy for one week, or at least for one day. he deserves to be loved for once. Just watched episode 21-22. Cry for Eun Chae A and Cheon So Hoo. I wish they married at the end, but that was impossible now. really love watching CSH\\'s character... Sad he is leaving... But hope he will get well soon.. God bless him always. I enjoyed watching every episode of this “Time” drama and and i love Soo Ho’s character. Hope KJH is okay now and that he will not be replaced in Soo Ho’s character. I admire you and hope to see you in other kdramas. Hope and pray that you’ll be back soon. Take care. I am waiting for the chemistry of Seohyun and Kim Jung Hyun though the line of KJH and Seohyun are heartwarrmings can\\'t help but fall in love withHwang Seung Eon; \\'cause Eun Chae A have a chemistry with Soo Ho. Get better soon Kim Jung-Hyun. Love u so much. Take good care of yourself. You come first. I hope to see you soon in other dramas. omg seohyun I think they should cast someone else. No point changing the story. Ultimately whoever replaces him won’t be as good as KJH but overall the story is getting interesting and I wouldn’t want it to be changed because KJH has dropped out. I hope he recovers... after all his health comes first... if he’s reading this I hope he knows we are all thinking of him and he’s made the right choice leaving the show. Don’t be upset we want you to get better that’s more important than anything else. You’ve worked very hard and you deserve recognition for that get well soon KJH? fighting!!!?? I don\\'t get why people are saying they will leave this drama just because soo ho won\\'t be in the drama it\\'s apart of the script he is originally supposed to die even if he left the drama the whole plot is really good you all should appreciate all the other actors efforts U know well he will probably die toward the end of the drama, show they just have to move it up sooner, at this stage I don\\'t think they will replacing his character at all, it\\'s episode 20 now, so I assume his character will die around episode 24-25. originally the script is set up for him to die at the end, this is unexpected, the lead is dropping out because of his health, for him to die early is not the original script, but will see how it will turn out. I can\\'t feel the connection between Soo Ho and Ji Hyeon. But somehow I can feel that for Soo Ho and Eun Chae A. i fall in love with soo ho\\'s character. The transition of his personality from reckless to be more thoughtful person is my fav part. My heart is frequently touched by him. although I\\'m being too subjective, the whole story is cool. No reason to stop the show, his character was always going to die(he has a terminal illness after all), they’re just moving it up instead of having it at the end with hopefully some good ramifications on the story. I enjoy this drama every episode. the KJH and Seohyun shows great acting, I hope PD not replace him.. I think soo ho will die..and after he die, the truth disclose.. And jihyun cannot repay him.. King Jung Hyun is leaving! Is this real? it so sad?... KJH will dropping out this drama... i like his acting in this drama.... it ok i will support this drama for seohyun ❤️❤️ This happened because he was too immersed with his character in his real life. Next time dont accept a drama if you can\\'t handle the character. @Time Korean Drama I think most probably they will make his character die since he has a terminal illness in the drama. No replacement, no waiting. kim jung hyun is dropping out? im lost.... googling now. love the drama & always looking fwd for the nxt eps. this drama is really underrated. now thinking whether i shld ctnue watching the drama... What\\'s going to happen then? Are they going to replace his character or wait until he hopefully gets better? Someone please find out <3 @Jess the song\\'s tittle is The End of the World. I prefer they cut the episode than change Soo ho\\'s role or Soo ho die sooner. At first I was hooked because Junghyun acting as Soo ho . I just could not imagine Shigan without Junghyun. Beside that Shigan supposed to be a drama about Soo ho\\'s limited time. And how Sooho value his remining time. I know Junghyun \\'s health come first. But i think I\\' ll drop this Now I want to hear all the people who criticised him because he looked \"angry\" during the press conference! He was sick and it was obvious:( so sad for him:(((( I was liking this so much...now he\\'s dropping out. Gonna miss him. Get well soon oppa I prefer they cut the episode than change Soo ho\\'s role or Soo ho die sooner. I just can\\'t watch Shigan without Junghyun. He is so good as Soo ho. And Shigan is a drama about Soo ho\\'s limited time. And how Sooho value his remining time. I know Junghyun \\'s health come first. Just thinking he\\' ll not be in Shigan drama anymore really made me sad T.T And I think I\\' ll drop this. Can someone tell me the title seohyun play a song to kim junghyun at the house Kim jung hyun will step down from this drama bcos of health issues. He is really a good actor. Gonna miss him. I hope he get well soon and can great us in his next project. And i hope his illness is not too serious. I love you kim jung hyun! Im so sad now.... Jung hyun out from this drama. Realy love his acting. But why...why..why.. You leave... Im so shock now...???? Just hoppe u get well soon jung hyun... ❤❤❤ loved how the actors portrayed their characters\\' depression so realistically, it really brought mental issues to light and I think this drama is amazing for that. i was angry with suho\\'s anger issues at first but slowly, i realized it was his defence mechanism and maybe a side-effect of his brain tumor. the scene where he saves her from committing suicide brought me to tears because it hits too close to home:\") So sad after hear about kim jung hyun This drama is all good and amazing, but I think they are just trying to drag everything. I mean 32 episodes for just a single case to get justice? A bit draggy. One episode per week is making the wait so difficult. I really wonder how will the story wind up now that most of the case has been broadcasted on tv but it\\'s only halfway through the episodes. Sure hope it\\'ll not become draggy... I love this drama ilove Kim Jung Hyun acting i love all about this drama amazing script Kinda good. But the male main lead -cheon soo ho- yelled almost everytime he opened his mouth in this drama... I watched with headset on hahaha:\\'( and why did they do all the police works? Like the police is so worthless. this is the first time ive ever watched korean drama. omg this is a really good drama. im sooo into it and i cant wait for the next episode. the main lead, both of them especially the girl is soooo good. i cried when she did the crying scene? i love it! I don’t watch so much Korean Dramas. The favorite is still Boys over Flowers. But Shigan, Time is terrific. I am in shock. It is heavy to watch coz it is full of drama. I am sure I won’t watch it again like BOF. However, am addicted to every new episode. Can’t wait for what will happen next. Thank you for making this cool series. This drama gives me story i watch because i want to know how they solved everything. Most drama of this time just for refresh your mood but this one is not.. they are telling the story The story is more alike like the Korean drama called \"secret love\" by Jo min-hyuk It was good right from the first episode. The suspense can be felt through out the episodes. It deserves a good rating I think, but I don\\'t know how Korean values the drama. Recommended to fill time slot for Thursday and Friday drama here. This drama is intense and both the leads have carried their roles in an awesome manner........ a Definite recommendation to watch for kdrama fans!!! I never trusted korean ratings. I don\\'t really judge the drama based on ratings, I have watched a lot of low rating dramas and they are better than the dramas with high rating. Like for example Secretary Kim after 3 episodes I got bored and stop watching but it has a very high rating and I love the actors . I don\\'t know what koreans are looking for in a drama maybe the casts popularity is number one for them. Anyway, SHIGAN is superb! Their acting and all. This us one if my fav. Kdrama, i waited for every episode so eagerly It’s been a Long time since such a refreshing drama has been aired! Very addictive! Well done and hopefully the ending will not be a disappointment! Thank you. this drama is superbbbbb awesome!!!! its a little dark as it appear in poster but super awesome Even with rookie actors, they nailed it! Don\\'t mind with the ratings, when time/shigan airs is the same slot with their sunbaes drama. One of them was in Choi Ho Chul\\'s work. It\\'s a bit dark but really great drama. Acting is superb too! I wish more people would watch it. hoping for better ratings. fighting team shigan! This writer Choi Ho Cheol has written my two favorite dramas so I am not sure why the low ratings, but I can tell you so far it lives up this usual skills. The actors are not bad either even though I am not that familiar with the two leads. I do feel that at this point it probably should have just been 16-20 episodes and it wouldn\\'t be losing its pacing like right about now. I hope it has a happy ending even though I cannot see how that could happen based on the set up. That is the main issue I have with the set up that it predetermines what the possible results could be - and maybe that alone deters people from watching. I hope their ratings pick up or I cannot see this going 32 episodes. Great drama, really love it, the acting is also not bad! I\\'ve waited the whole week for it. Does anyone know what\\'s with ep.13-14? They\\'re not out yet. A good drama. I like this kind of drama where are different from rom-com or romance. Thorough this drama i wonder how can the actors and actress be in the role. The actor which is Kim JungHyun is such a good rising star and the partner which i dont really familiar is Seo Ju Hyun. I know GG but to know that this girl is a good actress is such a mind blowing thing. Never know that a singer can act so skillfully. Anyway hoping the best for the drama and a good actress that can be look forward. Don\\'t get confused with the rating, the quality of the story and production is amazing, also the actors... a very good performance. Im gonna talk about this drama as a Seohyun fan with objective point of view. This is such a great drama! I hope more people will watch it. Seriously so underrated! The cinematography, script, music, acting are all on point! Why is the rating so low?? I really love this drama. Jung Hyun is so good at playing his role. The storyline is also very interesting. I wish a miracle happen~~I don\\'t want to see him dead? cheonseol!!! i love their chemistry. they both look great. this drama deserves a higher rating. time fighting!!! all cast and crew fighting!!! this drama highly recommended!!! The story is very good!!! wow what a surprise Kim Jung-Hyun is!!! As he is unfamiliar to me, his great acting ability is is partnered up with an excellent story-line that grabs your attention right from the start because of really good writers, great directing and supporting cast. I am totally enjoying watching Kim Jung-Hyun and I think he is someone to keep an eye on in the future as he is a rising star!! This is very touching drama and good drama for the storyline, cast, their performance. owhh..plz..let the hero live longer..i want the happy ending between the hero&heroin.! or else..im gonna die in dissapointmnt???..they re so good in acting..congrat..keep it up guys? If you think the storyline is cliche or similiar with secret you are wrong. If you already watch Secret and Mask you will know how good the scriptwriter making cliche story become unpredictable and addictive in the same time. Give it a try and you will not disappointed Best underrated drama this season. Much Onion. Why I got Uncontrollably Fonds feels in this drama time is very good drama. the actors are good and the production so amazing. every character is so interesting. good job all the cast and crew <3 Make me cry with this drama... Realy touching and hurt feeling... I really love this drama. Kim jung hyun acting so great. The writer is same writer of drama Mask and Secret love. I love it I love this! This drama really deserve better rating! Kim Jung Hyun deserve award!!! i hope that they will get a happy ending ~~ cheonseol<3 time hwaiting!! i really wished this drama got more attention for such a meaningful message within this drama. it\\'s literally so touching , though tbh min-seok gets on my nerves lmfao. its good so far and i hope the drama continues to get better!!! amazing drama, will watch till the end. highly recommend. will make u cry a lot. A very good drama and story. I really hope that they will get a happy ending by the end of this drama. And this drama deserves a recognition for having such a great actors. No doubt if this drama will win an award soon. Hoping also that GMA 7 will buy this drama, because I can\\'t imagine watching this in any other channel. Thank you and Congratulations to the actors and crew. Great job. It reminds me of Drama secret. The jerk one is her bf. And I am sure that it also similar that Soho will be falling in love with jihyun. It reminds me of Dr secret. The jerk one is her bf. And I am sure that it also similar that Soho will be falling in love with jihyun. time is really amazing kdrama!!!! I think the drama has low rating for obvious reasons. This drama is awesome who cares about the low rating, some people are just ridiculous plus their acting is amazing. I’ll be watching till the end. A very good drama and very good acting. It\\'s ridiculous the hate that Jung Hyun got for that presscon. Did he commit some sort of crime or something? He refused to link arms. Big woop. There are bigger problems in the world. Anyway, so far, this drama is great, and the acting is on point. Even Seohyun surprised me (at least until a certain scene in episode 6...). Ji hyun has nothing to lose now. All the heartbreak she has endured and will soon endure as more events and revelations happen. I can’t imagine the drought and endless pain and suffering she will feel. It’s even more melancholy because Soo Ho is going to die. Leaving her with no one. Not that it was circumstance that they were gonna be in love or anything, but you can’t deny that there would arise a friendship between them and if not a friendship, a sort of bond. Because now Ji Hyun has placed her trust in Soo Ho. i love him in welcome to waikiki. i can\\'t move on Wow~!!! This drama - daebak. Kim Jung Hyun is my new bias, after the \"Time\". On the other hand, Seohyun surprised me a lot. She doing so well I think I\\'ve cried in almost every episode since it came out. I keep crying even though I don\\'t want to because everybody\\'s storyline is heartbreaking. This is such a good show though! I give it two thumbs up. This is good drama, i am really addicted to watch every episode, dont you worry \\'bout the ratings, ratings are not everything, just watch and enjoy:D i really love this drama, kim hyun jung appeareance is the best part and i cant wait for. He has a talent, he act perfectly. Dont worry about low rating.. its not competition.. just enjoy the show.. if u forget about rating, you will find yourself enjoying the show more i don\\'t care if the ratings of this drama low, because for me this drama is really amazing. the story so good, their acting are great. i love cheonseol\\'s chemistry <3 i love kdrama from the plot not the ratings, time fighting ^^ shigan team fighting <3 Waiting for the next episode ^^ time fighting <3 the drama is so good ~~ I think his behavior in the press conference contributed to the low ratings XD Why the rating so low? Its really good drama tho what a great drama, good acting too from all the leads, can\\'t wait for next week!!! Time is good drama. Amazing! But I hate lowest rating. Why lowest rating??? I hope to high rating. Fighting for all! I can\\'t wating ep 9 & 10. Kim jung Hyun you are best!??? Good job guys! Fighting! Daebak... I can\\'t wait for the next episode, this drama reminds me with money flowet. I can feel the mistery, and the actors doing very well! Very recommend... Another typical Korean drama - plenty of tears; plenty of shouting; plenty of melodrama; plenty drag - those are the main ingredients that made up the rubbish dramas. “Time” will be no exception. Sigh! Actors portrayed character so damn well..! Wtf about scandal, I just love their acting! Woww time daebakkk.. The story so good.. Their acting are great, and cheonseol\\'s chemistry so amazing.. I’m glad SoMin declined. Coz the lead actor and actress chemistry in TIME is soooo good!!! <3 i love both individually!! And from their previous drama their roles are so good! Happy ending or sad ending? I think it can sad ending:( wow, i\\'ve low expectation with seohyun acting, but damn she is good. the best drama ever for the year of 2018 until now ! The drama is so good.. Time fighting CheonSeol FIGHTING!!!!!!!! good start...the rating rising all over The drama is amazing!! @Sweettiger The OST is called \"Time\" sung by Gaho. According to reports on Naver, it will be released this week!! So excited!! I\\'ve watched Kim Junghyun since his small role in Rebel and had high expectations of him on Time meanwhile I watched Seohyun on Moon Lovers so I had low expectations of her but I was so surprised how good she was on this drama. They were both soooo good! Plus this is a melodrama with one of my favorite writers and so far, I love how the story unfolds. Seems typical but the character development and twists in Choi Ho Chul\\'s dramas are a must-watch just like with Secret and Mask. I love you My ChoenSeol \"Time\" is a top quality drama with really fabulous actors, but the story is too emotionally draining for me. I can accept the terminal cancer of the main character (even if it displeases me), but I will never accept the younger sister\\'s killing. Making her die is too cruel and too unjust, and (in my humble opinion) unnecessary: she could\\'ve went into a coma or suffered injuries, and then get cured later. But I guess the theme chosen by the writer is the incurable and the irreversible, so I\\'m out of luck. I hope for the viewers that the ending will be less dark (I won\\'t say happy), but I won\\'t have the courage to wait for it myself... The ost of the drama, anyone know it? The song in episode 2 ending. Please let me know if some know it The first two episodes were good, and the lead actors are good too. Smthng is really wrong wth shin minseok. Kim jung hyun\\'s acting is really good in this drama.:) Omg!! The drama is so good!! This is my type of drama!! i like the leading girl suffering and miserable lol then be happy in the end xD I love this! This drama is good drama. Can\\'t waiting ep 5 & 6. This drama\\' writer is good! Fighting, KJH & SH. To be honest, i feel like this is the combination of Secret and Mask drama but with different execution and i\\'m here ready for the plot twist. I hope this drama get a lot of recognition since Junghyun give his life to be ruined by Choen Soo Ho. Why the secretary looks like his dongsaeng -_- Best Drama, it s real about poor family vs rich family. Even though I don\\'t really care for drama\\'s where the protagonist death is set, I love this writers previous work so I am watching this, hoping for a miracle cure by the end. Why do some of their mothers behave like kids, she literally caused the death of her daughter bcos of her selfishness and ran away. What a bad mother What incredible acting cast. Im already in love with Seohyun all over again. Her acting skills are no joke, and seriously she’s just so beautiful! He play very difficult role which may not all rookie actors can play it, but he did it. He deserves to be appreciated. Fighting KJH. Never disappointed with KJH\\'s acting I love the how the lead actor act..he really good!!! He portrayed the characters very well. So does Seo hyun.i love both of them.i just hope that the lead actor does not die.PLEASE.i just don’t want another sad ending?? i just watched the ep and the story the cinematographie the acting was just woow I just watch 2 first eps. And i have to say that KJH was totally smash it. He transformed so much. Netizen is not always right. I don\\'t want something bad happen to him. (Well if u guys know what i mean) anytime when you feel you need shrink. Just do it. We always support you and we will enjoy your acting. Fighting. Awesome acting!!!! Amazing chemistry I read something similar when Heath Ledger was going into character for the Joker in the Dark Knight. For example he wouldn\\'t wash and then ride the train. The other commuters would complain about his smell, his attire and his attitude. It\\'s method acting and it just doesn\\'t turn off. To portray a darker character and to play it well you need to be in character 24/7, it isn\\'t as simple as switching a light on and off. And Heath Ledger done an excellent job in the role. Good for KJH to want to do his best too and you can see he\\'s really trying as it is a complete contrast to his personality. Bigger roles could come out of the way he acts in this and he won\\'t be pegged just for rom coms then. In all he should have apologised for his actions and underlined why he acted like that. Your acting skill save your LIFE arrogant boy , Too make people stop attack you ... Wow .. Wow .. Wow .. :-/ Dbsbaka do you know him personally? One mistake he made defines who he is? let me clap for your lack of understanding. He is still learning to manage his chara so not come ruined his own life. Then you hate this guy that didn\\'t ruin your life, what\\'s your problem?don\\'t you see he is suffering too? People are over reacting he wasn\\'t even that rude, and also if he was trying to stay in character and is a method actor then it\\'s totally understandable. I mean Jared Leto sent Margot Robbie a rat when he was playing the Joker. Method actors need to immerse themselves in their characters, maybe people just didn\\'t notice he was doing it because his other characters have been lighthearted. Please don\\'t call it gender biased or \"he is an actor not idol\" because he still bashed by knetz, and of course its not about he is not professional, because he is still rookie actor, he is still learning. leads acting is so good I watch laughter in waikiki before n now im a bit curious abt KJH in this drama KJH\\'s acting? Good. @khusi gupta: i disagree with \"they will said the actor is touchy\" please search all the presscon of other drama and you will know. (the lead actress also had other presscon with other lead male actor and no one is complaining) I know what he means( kjh )by into the character. I remember there is also an actress that should be act angry and evil Everytime when she play the TV series. She said that she had health issue due to she must play evil and angry character mostly in scene. Her blood pressure is high. So I can understand it if you really act into character. It can influence your real life even your health. Will there be any romance in this drama? korean writers need some creativity about the names since the daily drama the birth of a family the name soo ho is everywhere it\\'s the new replacement for \"Ji Eun\" that i hear since Full House. Their acting are great!!! Shigan team daebak!!! good! Time is so amazing kdrama!!! Time fighting <3 I don\\'t really get people who are attacking him for being deep into the character!! Many actors get affected by their characters... why are you all attacking him?! If he can\\'t separate between his character in a drama and his daily life means he is not a professional actor. Up to this day the controversy between KJH is still on fire and most of SH fans are still angry and dismay against him but i\\'m thankful that they are still some kdrama fans who are neutral. to those people who hate him and can\\'t take to see him, then don\\'t watch his drama (time) di kayo kawalan. time\\'s trailer are already intense what more the whole drama, in those trailer KJH already give chill to his character & he will going to portray his role above\\'s everyones expectation! Shigan D-Day^^ time fighting:) Can\\'t wait tomorrow!! Time fighting ^^ it\\'s unfortunate that until this point there are still so many people pointing fingers to KJH. i am no fan of both either KJH or SH but since i knew nothing because i\\'m not an actress, i have zero knowledge of character development and how big would a drama character impacted on someone\\'s life. videos published so far are mostly about the controversy, why couldn\\'t they publish ones that include KJH almost tearing up at the interview. just like @Nobies said, everyone surely has different way to get to know their character they are portraying. some even isolating themself, some even getting treatments by going to the psychiatrist. his Cheon Suho character is an arrogant dying man who got no love and disbelieve from his own family which is not a light and easy one, unlike his previous character on Waikiki. i just hope that people will soon stop publishing hatred comments especially when we knew nothing. not just because an actor is a rookie or is not an idol-becoming-actor does not means he do not deserve understandings. try to understand actors just like you would understand idols Lee Seo Won ( controversy sexual harassment ) , Jung Hae In ( controversy at Baeksang awards ) , And now Kim Jung Hyun controversy .... Seriously why now new korean actor have bad attitude?? No wonder Idol Kpop actor now easy take Main Lead in Kdrama better than real korean actor . After controversy i just really wish main lead dont have any KISS SCENE..That guy dont like Seohyun so please dont touch Seohyun , That guy so arragont with Seohyun so please stay away form Seohyun! I get it now why Kim Jung Hyun said he wanted to be in character during the presscon. I know it was rude of him to reject Seohyun\\'s arm but every story has two sides of it and we\\'ve only seen one. Behind the cameras, behind closed doors, maybe there is a man struggling to become a character that is angry at the world, at himself. Actors sometimes go for beyond measures to become the character they have to be. Take for example Seo Ye-Ji who acted in Save Me. She admitted on the interview that she isolated herself for 6 months just so she can understand the character and be that person. She said she felt hopeless and in too much pain to the point she questioned if her life was so pointless after all. It\\'s not easy to become someone else. Maybe Kim Jung Hyun potrayed that very role he has in the drama in the presscon, a coldhearted person. Its not easy to become an angry, coldhearted person. Kim Jung Hyun on his last drama Waikiki had a much more brighter character and he showed it that he can. I hope you also take consideration his point of view. kjh hwaiting Cheon Soo-Ho ( Kim JungHyun drama: Time ) Cha Soo-Ho ( Lee Yi-Kyung drama: Partner for Justice ) Most of inetz & knetz pointing fingers on KJH, when no one knows whats he\\'s been going through, he\\'s using method acting to make his role more realistic and most of the actors using that kind of method ended up suffering anxiety & depression. that little action of his toward the female lead made a lot of hate towards him, He\\'s a human he can\\'t be perfect or he will never be, but the scandal can ruin his career (Hope,not) the career his been building for so many years. He already apologize so stop the hate towards him.. don\\'t forget watch shigan on 25th july guys!!!! please give a lot of love for this drama... All the cast and staff fighting ^^ No wonder , SONE all around the world + Kpop fans + Kdrama fans really angry what he doing to Seohyun!! He attitude is very bad . It\\'s okey Seohyun i support this drama:) Just becouse Seohyun! I cant wait watch this drama.. Even though there are have controversy about KJH toward seohyun. I\\'m always support you seohyun unnie.. I really hope this drama will be get high rating.. D-2 ~~ can\\'t wait for 시간 ^^ Fighting all team shigan;) And I want to add one more point.....look at his all previous press conferences ...he is so cheerful in that, so there can be a problem that we all don\\'t know . Oppa fighting!! I am going to support you?? Dbsbaka: If the actress would have done the same thing, would everyone have criticized her as you all are doing now?? ...everyone would have said that the actor was trying to be touchy and blah blah excuses... So lets understand him also and humans make mistakes ( he already apologized) The teasers looks really good, I\\'m really looking forward to this drama, regardless of the presscon incident, I hope this drama keeps a lot of viewers and high ratings. Shigan fighting! @khusi gupta: it\\'s okay not to holding hand with her but you made that face and rejected your co-star like that make your co-star embarrassed in front of public is okay? (Linking arms is so basic and you can often find actor/actress do that in presscon). @watch: SUHO didn\\'t do something rude and make that face to his co-star. Please check SUHO\\'s presscon video. Hey guys, what is wrong with not holding a girl\\'s hand?? And he told he is trying to be in his character of drama. He would be going through something, how can you judge him by just something so small and wth everyone is calling him rude?? And there are some people telling that they will drop out this drama just becoz of that incident. Huh!!! ....it is just a small issue and everyone is taking to next level, he is a cheerful person, lets try to understand him from his point of view.... It\\'s understandable how some of you guys are pissed off with his attitude during the press conference. I can\\'t fully understand his thinking either at that time but he\\'s probably into the role so much he doesn\\'t want to ruin it by acting out of the character of his role in the drama? I don\\'t know if he is actually polite or not in real life but so far he had built great relationships with his co-stars and the prods he worked with so i dont really think it\\'d be because of the fame that had eaten away his humbleness or whatnot. I believe Kim Jung Hyun isn\\'t foolish enough to ruin his own career by acting cocky on in front of the media lol I am seohyun fans but please be mature. seohyun can handle the awkward situation with nice attitude, and why you all can do that too? It just make seohyun has more haters. Please give a lot of love for this drama:) Don\\'t cancel drama \"time\" on 25th july please:( please support all the cast and staff of drama \"time\";) it will be quality drama ^^ time family fighting!! <3 please give a lot of love for this drama:) Be GENTLE bro ... Please respect Seohyun as Women , As your partner . why y\\'all pressed at this KJH, just because of his attitude towards Seohyun. Suho did the same thing towards his co-star and y\\'all weren\\'t mad. the double standards of netizens. Just because Seohyun and Suho are more popular than the other actors, doesn\\'t mean that you should not treat the rest like they are not a big part of the drama. I really don’t kw what’s going on, but the male lead guy attitude at the press conference piss me off so much, he should be more professional man, I just feel so sorry to Seohyun??? Enough about the other guy. Praise Seohyun for her professional and charasimatic attitude and bright personality for always being respectful and mannered towards her endeavours. Seohyun has been in the camera’s for more than 10 years at most. I admire her for every bit of her efforts. I’m already troubled the comments are turned off that she’s the lead female role. If you can’t handle it, this isn’t the right place for you. Drink your tea somewhere else. Some of us genuinely like Seohyun, with others negative comments being spread on here, it’s disrespectful and it may be your opinion. But your opinion doesn’t become relevant anymore. You diss the Maine of Girl’s Generation, you diss the whole Sone fandom. why is everyone hung up on the fact that jh is paired up with Seohyun? The guy is acting with the precious maknae of the nation’s girl group, the bubbly and bright Seojuhyun, the most professional and charismatic woman in the world and the iconic “shake it” stan. Seohyun has been in the industry for over 10 years, she has earned and gained respect to her seniors as well as her partners and co workers.  Drama looks interesting. However, Jonghyun\\'s attitude at the promotion event was such a turn off. I will probably pass on this drama. Can\\'t wait for shigan!! <3 time family fighting ~~ Junghyun is one of my favorite kactors but then again WHY SEOHYUN WHYY! I\\'ll have to pass this oof.. I can\\'t wait to watch another Junghyunie project again. I know international fans can\\'t impact anything but still let support until the end. We can do it! Fighting yeorobuuuuunnn!!! can\\'t wait for the drama it looks intense and promising Kim Jung Hyuuuuuunnnnnnnnnnn opppaaaaaa????? Teasers are so intense. Good luck I just saw the two teasers and God it was super intense! Cant wait for the drama! Seohyun and Kim Junghyun\\'s eye gaze and that scene where he says, \"If you decide to die, I\\'ll die with you\".. OMG! My heart??? After School 2017 and Eulachacha Waikiki let me just remove the image of naughty, hilarious, and crazy Kim Jung Hyun on my mind before watching this heheh niceeee Can\\'t wait!!! Time, shigan fighting ^^ Can\\'t waiting..... Waiting for junghyun seohyun Another description of the characters: Shin Min Seok has been with Seol Ji Hyun (dating) for six years (wonder what happen between them). The plot is likely similar in uncontrolably fond There has been no updare on the date because the come and hug me drama has been drlayed due to the world cup so they havent got a definite date yet - i think this is why:) Why there\\'s no update of this drama? Until now there\\'s no specific date of airing? Looking forward to this drama Seohyun, I don\\'t know how you\\'ll do, but I hope you hit success as an actress. There\\'s no coincidence that she got this role because of her work with the director in Bad Thief, Good Thief. I hope this is a sign that the director recognize her worth. Shigan .. Shigan .. Shigan .. I need Shigan\\'s update asap I\\'m here waiting for the teaser YASSSS!! Queen is back along side with one of the most handsome and talented actors in Korea. I\\'m sure that this drama is going to be a bomb!! Great actor and popular idol..This drama looks like it will be nice & popular too. But I dont want to expect much at the beginning, especially for seohyun.She is already received this drama project, I hope she givesthe best for this drama.Not just popularity but also quality!.. =)? Oh my I saw some photos of them filming already! Excited muuuch!!!!!! I know this is too early but I want to see the teaser so bad! lool seohyun dad is here in the new drama from bad thief , good thief kim jung tae loool amazing drama it not your family drama is quite dark and emotional Can\\'t wait for this! This rare thing happens when your favs are together in a drama! It better be good writernim! Ehe.. Well, I am trusting the writer since Secret and Mask are very well written. D-49 woooohooooo D-49 woooohoooo I\\'m so so excited for this......especially for Seohyun. I know she\\'s an idol......but I love her acting. TIME DAEBAK!!!! Hwaiting oppa...!! ❤ I know you can do the best for this drama...!! Can\\'t wait...?? I mean rival in slot drama lol i\\'m so excited!!!! @kkkkkk So, he actually surrounded by SooHo name lol his bestfriend (Suho EXO), his character in TIME drama, his ex co-star character and his soon to be rival is SooHo hahaha @yyh16: Me too. Even popular idol like Suzy Siwon Yoona etc. Not bcoz they r bad in acting, buy there was a strange atmosphere while watching it. I think im the only one who feel it, but it turns out u too. Lol @waitingtime: I will add Lee Yi Kyung (Waikiki Lee Junki) character name in his new drama is also Soo Ho. His full name is Cha SooHo. Lol In the same slot drama will air a character named SooHo too. Is SooHo name represent a chaebol? Why Seohyun?? Is there no other artist?? I never liked watching Korean dramas with main cast an idols. It\\'s weird to see they acting when usually see them sing and dance on stage. But I\\'m going to watch this drama for Kim Jung Hyun. I like him in drama school 2017 and totally love him in drama Waikiki. He\\'s a great actor. really cant wait to see these two together, i think they will have great chemistry!!! Collaboration of two rising star actor+actress with 2017 MBC Best Newcomer Award in their hands. @Mona: I don\\'t think he will be sick like uncontrollably fond but let\\'s see LOL for those who are judging the actors specially Seohyun without majoring in film and directing then you might as well keep it to yourself. I checked Seohyun profile, she got a Best new comer award and a Special acting award. She already has accomplishment as an actress. She got the awards coz she deserves it. Let those who are in the right position judge. Don\\'t judge based on hearsays, better yet do NOT judge at all. (just sayin\\') Uncontrollably Fond I love the screenwriter but i dont get that What happend to \\'\\'The Happiest Time of My Life\\'\\'? @Vangie, Seohyun is not under SM anymore. I hope July will come very soon. I\\'m not really a fan of melodrama, i prefer comedy and romantic comedy. But because my ultimate bias i like this kind of plot just like @CKW said below, juicy but i somehow love it. i\\'m a sucker for melodrama esp when it involve dying male lead. is this supposed to be KJH will be sick and thus he\\'s dying or some kind of fate which put his life in danger to the terms of \"dying\"? waiting for this drama. and for all those who are slandering seohyun even when the drama is not released,those people - keep your hate 4 yourself. @Vangie, fully disagreed. I don\\'t even like SNSD and I can admit that Yoona and especially Sooyoung act well. Do Kyungsoo is not the only good idol in SM that can act lawl Seohyun in Bad Thief, Good Thief was also passable. Nothing to fawn over but not bad either. Also dismissing someone before an episode as even aired is a really bad idea. Not to mention, SJ\\'s Siwon is also a good actor. @vangie are you watching bad thief good thief? It would be better if the lead female is not Seohyun. She is my bias in snsd but I have to be fair about her acting. The only SM artist who can really act is Do Kyungsoo. Yes, not even Yoona who has been in the industry for quite a while. After Woo Do Hwan\\'s acting put into waste with Joy, it will be Kim Jung Hyun now whose talent will be wasted. I just hope Seohyun agreed to this cause she can pull it off. I just really hope she underwent workshops and trainings for the role. Junghyun is in Hongkong for filming? They started super early, glad to hear it. Oh he caused the wreckage in her life? Juicy. I love plots like this. Reminds me of Beyond the Clouds and Secret Love, both excellent Kdramas. Wow..reunion between Seo Hyun and Kim Jung Tae after \"Bad Thief Good Thief\" as father and daughter hehehe \\'Time\\' cast went out for some drinks last night! Glad they\\'re taking time to bond before they start shooting. Hope this drama will hit daebak. Love the main leads, love the writer. I love this writer, Kim Jung Hyun was good in Welcome to Waikiki, Seohyun pretty and her acting is ok, in the last drama too. Cant wait! Aaaaahhhh can\\'t wait?? Seohyun.......the only reason I will watch this!!!! I am not into melodramas but since it\\'s Seohyun I will definitely watch it I swear only Seohyun can make me want to watch a kdrama. I very rarely watch kdramas, but this woman is making me want to watch one. The power she has... Three reasons I\\'m really going to watch this: because it\\'s Kim Jung Hyun, Seohyun and the writer! Secret love and Mask are one of my fav kdrama. I guess TIME would be a good story too! Can\\'t wait I hope the admin adds the main leads already. Both Seohyun and Kim Junghyun are confirmed!!! I\\'m so happy Dong Gu has a new drama this fast after Waikiki! update: Both Kim Jung Hyun and Seohyun confirmed to lead in this drama called \\'Time\\' . The 1st script reading will be on April 28, 2018. I\\'m still waiting for them to confirm this. OMG! Kim Jung Hyun in another drama!!! I\\'m excited for this. He was super funny in Waikiki and it will be great to see a different side of him in a melodrama. I havent watched a single drama Seohyun was in so I dont have any idea how good she is but just based on the two\\'s visuals, i think they\\'ll look good together. Please accept the role, Kim Jung Hyun. I already missed him after Waikiki. He played Kang Dong Gu to perfection and he is such a great actor. This role will show how versatile he is. And as for Seohyun, I have seen her in Moon Lovers and she was okay there, she wasn\\'t the lead so I can\\'t judge her acting based on that. But I am totally in with this pairing. Seohyun is considering the main female lead role. I\\'ve been waiting for Choi Ho Chul\\'s new drama coz Secret and Mask are still the best korean melodramas I\\'ve ever watched. Glad he\\'s writing another melodrama this 2018. Cabt wait for July! Please accept it. Hwaiting. Hmm not really sure about this cast but I will trust it .... fighting',\n",

       "  'comments': 'the characters did a nice job, because the drama is indeed funny. Kang Cho-Hong might not be the smartest witch around, but I\\'m fan of these 3 actors. And there are a few confusing places...I\\'m still not sure I understand. Still, I want to see what happens in this drama. So hee previous drama ruler master of the mask was daebak but unfortunately, you know you can\\'t beat so hyun popularity. Seriously Yoon So-Hee deserve more than this! The writers are hands down sloppy & what a crappy story. AM SO DISAPPOINTED! The Two Grannies was Daebak! Also Jung Young-Joo appearance was priceless,\\tits sad that people are judging this because of the low ratings. <3 im loving it I love this drama, I\\'m addicted to this drama The grandmothers were the best characters so as je wook the female lead is sooo cute she kind of take after IU.. (but her crying scenes were very bad) ... Male lead hmm not a big fan Ok I don’t understand why people are saying the main leads are bad. The totally have chemistry and the storyline could be better. ALL the actors performances were outstanding especially the male lead. You can really feel he’s arrogance at times but also when he’s being kind you can feel it. This drama was really good you should give it a try. Tbh the storyline is weak, but after this ending I need a second season.or at least extra episodes. I would say this is the best ending of a drama so far, despite the weak storyline, the ending is so good. I loved this drama. the only thing that was our of place or tiring was tthe love triangle! Snooze, it doesn\\'t last long though. Bring you could argue for a minute it occurs 2 times. Anyway, I love the family Dynamics here. Each character was developed fairly well and this satisfies cravings for mystery, romance, and comedy. It was a feel good drama that I would recommend. The chemistry was there. At times the female lead felt childish but it was great seeing thing developed. My only complaint is the rush plot on the mystery side by give it a chance! Try to watch this . Since episode5 this is so cute so funny . This realy good Yoon Soo-Hee is as awesome in her role as usual but the lead actor Hyun Woo is just tad bad. I gave him another chance with this drama knowing all too well that he kinda sucks at acting based on the dramas I\\'ve watched of him. But I don\\'t get it. Why hasn\\'t he improved yet? He\\'s one of the worst actors I\\'ve witnessed. Like this short and entertaining dramas very much. So many chessy scenes made times passed so fast to watch. Love the couple plus the second lead actors, they are very good-looking. Never forget the secretary Kim and both lovely grandmas. with 12 eps i kind of knew beforehand that this drama will have a lack of development for the main character but it is still cute and light and its still pleasing to watch Light story but i like it This is a complete waste of time to watch. Skip this drama. Watch something else. I just wasted about 12 hours of my life. the main lead hyun woo is a really bad actor ,the 2 grandma were PERFECT and reaally good and funny hongbin also did well ,but they could give him more screen time or a better character. I did not fall in love with the leads at all. Their love seemed forced. There was no chemistry for me at all. The plot lacked a lot in terms of how this guy went from a hated building owner to the \"person she loved most in this world\". I htink it was a flat and with no real emotions on both sides. 5/10 for me Plz plz plz plz can anyone tell me the name of the soundtrack that played when jo aeng doo\\'s (cho hong\\'s grandma) lover left her in ep 9 .. i would be so thankful Ahh, Yoon So Hee is so adorable. I remember her from Marriage Not Dating, and she\\'s super cute in this show too. Although I miss how she is at the beginning of the show, super spunky and full of life. It gets tempered a bit when she has to hide her secret. I liked the wild and wacky life she lives in the beginning. Except of course without the dirtbag boyfriend. The drama was a cute and lighthearted watch, and a simple plot of what I\\'d expect out of a short 12-episode drama (I mean, it\\'s only 12 episodes, so I never expected for there to be much character development or mind-blowing plot twists/complications). But for a 12-episode drama, I felt like the beginning was kind of slow and there were a lot of unnecessary scenes that could\\'ve been left out. For instance, what was even the point of introducing the celebrity girl in the beginning? She didn\\'t even appear again after the first few episodes. Pretty much a waste of time considering she has no role in plot progression. Some of the fights/misunderstandings the couple had seemed kind of petty and repetitive, but I\\'m glad they usually come to resolve them easily. Yeah, the male lead has a cold personality that can get irritating sometimes, but that\\'s what makes it so special when he\\'s actually warm and affectionate towards Cho Hong. He only ever smiles when he is with her or thinking about her. It\\'s pretty cute and sweet actually. Soo disappointed, I thought throughout the last episodes she \\'ll go to her fated man. I HATED the main lead and this drama lacked strong feelings. it\\'s just too superficial for me. I love it super like the lead man and woman this kdrama is just light, and with adorable characters... it\\'s a feel good, heartwarming kdrama <3 Hope to see what more Yoon So-Hee can do in future roles. I think she\\'s underrated. Seen a lot of Kdramas lately - often the heroine in a crying scene. For the most part, it\\'s just tears on a blank face - and to me - forced over the top crying. But those extreme close ups of Yoon\\'s face with a single tear falling - expressed a lot. Not sure what it is yet - directing, lighting, or just a one time acting occurence. So hope to see more. I don\\'t like the male lead for some reason i prefer Jae wook the male lead Why it ends so early? One of the best kdramas. So sad there were only 12 episodes. I would like to know why the episodes were cut to 12. It was showing 16 ep. everywhere.. I really enjoyed the drama . Loved the characters. I thought our main couple were great together. Some complained about how cold Hyun Woo was. That was the character he was supposed to play. If you didn\\'t like him then I guess he played his part well.. I will probably watch this again sometime. Very nice!!!! I love every bit of it. I\\'m going to miss it. AHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! I will miss this series... defo watching this again...though i feel the plot was a bit rushed at the end but WOW!!! I thought is was gonna be 16 episodes for some reason.... tsk3... love the pairing of YSH and HW... LHB is a bit annoying, too childish but great char nonetheless... One of the best funniest romantic korean drama i have ever seen This show was daebak! will be watching it again. I thought that although it was only 12 eps it was done right. It did not feel rushed and the actors were amazing. The lead actors relationship was goals! The halmonis were cute and funny. This drama made me happy and want some more. It was hilarious and the ending was just right and satisfying! GREAT PRODUCTION! Fun and lighthearted drama! Love it but too short, only 12 episodes so the plot, although interesting seems like not fully developed. Regardless enjoy it and the casts are wicked! Is it really only 12 episodes???? Ohhh noooo moreeee morreee episode:) Why did they cut the episodes to 12? Hyun Woo & Yoon So Hee have a chemistry, their kisses seem natural like they\\'re both enjoying such scenes and could really pass as real couple. Also they could have used more of Hong Bin\\'s character than just making him as the web comic writer and friend especially on the last few episodes. love this drama but 2nd male lead actor is more handsome and nice then first Love the drama but the male lead actor I don\\'t like him for some reason he is a little bit to much he is not fun to watch. Hwang jewook is perfect for the male lead I love he acting Je-wook is great performance. Title track sounds sooo much like shout out to my ex? good drama The main lead male actor is a bit off putting. Can’t stand him for some reason. Sung-Tae is for sure the one for Cho-Hong. Je-Wook\\'s personality was the typical character of a second male lead. xD Chohong-Sungtae\\'s chemistry is great!!! their kisses and hugs are goals Sung-Tae is for sure the one for Cho-Hong. Je-Wook\\'s personality was the \"typical\" character of a second male lead. xD Sweet drama , I like so much <3 that is so cool...ship is sailing...that kiss is so sweet!! I love this drama omg thank god i discovered this I would love if Cho Hong would end up falling in love with Sung Tae.♥️? Really who is who?? Sung-Tae might accept her, this is all new to him and its had bad experience with witches so I don\\'t blame his suspension and curiosity. I think Hwang Je-Wook can\\'t handle Kang Cho-Hong. Once everything is clear Sung-Tae will accept or even sacrifice for her. I am so put off by Sung Tae. I hope she chooses Jae Wook over him. alas. Wooow This a really nice Kdrama! But I would really Like if Cho Hong would end up with Jae wook! He is really kind, dorky and I kinda like him more than Sung tae.. But (based on my experience in Kdramas) the Female lead falls for the man with a dark past and that he is always very serious or is the Director of a big company, leaving the Second-male-lead ... Oh and let\\'s not forget! Besides the love triangle between Cho Hong, Jae wook and Sung Tae, there might be a love triangle between Cho Hong, Jae wook and the actress girl, in the first episodes! That would make the drama, more... Interesting? I mean, doesn\\'t everyone has a purpose in the movies/ series? @abbie it might be easier if she falls for je wook...he is the one that will Give unconditional love, will accept whoever she is. But she is gonna fall in love to sung tae, and will face heart broken and betrayal again due to sung tae’s history, he will not accept that she and her family are witches. Hongbin oppa, I am falling for you again and again! I love this drama so much!! Funny and fantastic.. Keep it up all the cast of witch love specially the writer. Hope the destined one is sung tae..:) love from Philippines... Saranghae VixX Hongbinnie...... even u wear rags ur still handsome...hahahha... I\\'m going to love this drama.... witch theme is kinda interesting to me since Harry Potter... magic,potion and everything.... not bad..but fall short with very obvious writer trying to spice up the polt. @Kira: yes it\\'s good, romance is funny and touching too Wahhh!! Im confused about who is her destined man? Sung Tae or Je-wook? Je wook was there when the bell rang too and his is going to do the CPR on her on the next episode. Im so confused! I want it to be Sung Tae because cho hong and him were already connected since they were both young. Is this good? The romance? I wanna watch it because of Hyun Woo. I love him in his other drama especially in My Dear Cat. He is a total handsome cutie! I\\'m not familiar with this female lead though. wahhh this is wonderful i started watching it fully prepared to have a second leading man syndrome but as i watched it i came to love the chemistry of the two main.. for me they have a great chemistry and i like the story hehehe i even watched 6 episodes in just one night. its really fun to watch.. besides i love the girl she\\'s L\\'s oppa first kiss on drama hehehe Hyun Woo has face resemblance with B1A4 Gong Chan!! What do you think? lov the chemistry between the leading actors, interesting plot line too! i\\'ve been eyeing on this oppa...hyun woo...He really is a gem? Second lead syndrome is too strong with this one...? Only on ep 5 though. I love this kdrama the first time I watched the trailer. Looking forward for the next episode, can\\'t wait actually!? I really really like this drama Interesting story and I like this couple and second lead role hong bin oppa ?? randomly decided to watch Witch\\'s Love yesterday and it was an excellent choice and I LOVE IT! kangcho is soft like a baby and sungtae is so cute. I love their lovehate relationship. I love this drama the 2 lead star are both look good together! So far I’m enjoying this drama! Although I prefer the 2nd lead Hong Bin. Hoping he gets more airtime because I don’t see any chemistry with the two main leads as of yet. Looking forward to the next episodes!!! Hyun Woo is the male lead. It\\'s too obvious from the teaser. The hyunwoo guy sorta looks like ChanYeol Who is the guy who works at the bank? i am watching this for hongbin but the story is interesting. hope he will get more screentime. Who is lead male here? Hyun woo or hongbin? This drama is sooo interesting!!! Although I was waiting for hongbin to come out in ep 1 (although he didn\\'t) I was still sucked in by the plot! I normally love fantasy movies/dramas so I know I\\'ll love it..and I just watched the first ep ..so good...shes so pretty..cannot wait for next episode....this will be my replacement for \"whats wrong with secretary Kim\" hah... so excited for my man hongbin and my queen so hee!! Hongbin♥️♥️♥️ I\\'m gonna watch it for Hongbin but the plots looks quite good i wonder how it would be So excited for this drama... Hongbin <3 Yoon So Hee will be playing a witch is all I\\'ve signed up for. The plot sounds interesting too. Oh I love Hyun Woo in My Dear Cat!:) He is so cute! More of Yoon So Hee~ niceeeee! Still cant move on from your great performance on Ruler: Master of the Mask, you deserve that award there. Fighting noona! Lowkey sounds like Kiki’s Delivery Service. Seems interesting, will watch. This show looks adorable. Kind of thinking of live recapping it, but might just watch it instead (so many shows are on Wednesday and Thursday!). I surely won\\'t miss it! So excitedd so excited for this!! my queen so hee finally a lead role!! hope they cast either jisoo or choi tae joon for this OMG I reallly like her~ So excited for this. Cried so much in Ruler:Master of the mask because of her maybe Hyun Woo as male lead yassss..Love her in ruler of the mask T.T Why?! she was very good in ruler, master of the mask fighting noona! excited for this drama! When I see the word witch in K-drama it has nothing to do with witchcraft, but the plot says it does so I will wait. I have no hard feelings toward soo hee, but I don\\'t understand the hype with her casting. I\\'ve watch her acting in my love eun-dong, the one with kim so hyun (don\\'t remember the title) and others, but i can\\'t feel her acting. Please cast Jisoo/Gong myung/Choi tae joon/Kim min jae ❤❤❤ Ji soo plz cast yoo seung ho.. love them together..',\n",

       "  'comments': 'Everytime i hear ost Shine-Kim EZ, i wanna cry... Beautiful song from this drama, crush my heart... Geudaeui ongiro gamssajugireul, Shine on me... Love this song and this drama... Yoon Shi Yoon very handsome . Just finished the drama now. The ending feels rushed and there were no concrete solution to the twin brothers family problem. I would like rather have then resolve both of their issues rather than the ending of happy romance since it is titled Your Honor mainly focusing on the two main male character. They didn’t even gave justice to the character of the real judge. The actor was really good but the plot is very poor. I would give this a 7.5 mainly because of the actor. If the actor was bad, I would definitely give it a 1/10. The premise of the story was great. as a law student about to take the bar exam, my professors always say in law remove sentiment from your judgment. don\\'t allow sentiment and morality cloud your judgment. the act by So Eun going to meet witnesses themselves to ask what happen. she uses her past experience to determine results. A beautiful and enjoyable drama , although I don\\'t like the legal dramas but these are different I loved it and didn\\'t feel bored anytime, really one of the best dramas this year, good job for all cast and another wonderful work for Yoon Si-Yoon ♥♥ Hope there will be part 2. Really enjoyed but too many unanswered questions in eps 32. Feels like its still not finish. This was really enjoyable to watch. Like how they wrapped it all up at the end Still waiting for an update... searched everything on the net hoping to find episodes 33-40 as what I have seached in google that this supposed to have 40 episodes but what happen? Any explanation? What will happen to those bad guys?? Though this is really a good drama and I can even rate this to 10 but somehow it\\'s really hard to accept that it ended just like that.. goshhhh... I Need Explanation... Why??? I really want to know why they cut the episode.. nothing on the news..:( Yoon si yoon really deliver the character like two different person. i even think they really two different person. Yoon shi Yoon great actor/Your honor drama is nice drama, every drama by him is always Awesome (perfect), highly recommended for viewing!??? Great story. I really like it. I kinna agree the coment down below. The team kinna rush all the thing in last episode. I guess there are still more episodes left. My friend told me that dunggo mentioned that they still have 6 episode left. That was in 2 days and 1 night. Still hoping for more episodes. Love this drama soooo much...:) The drama is great but the ending is a little bit rush.. Seems like pd nim want to end the drama exactly at 16 episode.. So many question, hanging story.. I wish they add more episode, so the story will complete.. Anyway great drama.. I\\'m so in love with this drama...The actors are all superb, everyone is outstanding even the actors who are playing minor roles in the drama are all superb... This is a must watch... I LOVE IT!!! Drama was daebak ❤️? The last 2 episodes felt rushed as some issues were resolved quickly and squeezed like the arc on the sister however there are a lot of issues that seemed resolved but not really clear on their resolution like what happens to the relationship between Kang Ho and Soo Ho, what becomes of Soo Ho after is he just in hiding the whole time? Sang Cheol and the prosecutor were left unpunished or no ounce of retribution on their part, Joo-Eun and Soo Ho\\'s relationship is in limbo from the beginning to the end, why didn\\'t they bring back Kang Ho back in the family register to undo the adoption in paper? To be honest the leads had no real chemistry. So Eun seemed a lot older than Kang Ho even though her voice is like that of a child or teen. I just hope they focused more on Kang Ho impersonating Soo Ho and being the judge than the love arc of Kang Ho and So Eun or more focus on the conflict between Kang Ho and Soo Ho. Too many opportunities to improve the story but unfortunately they focused on the love arc which was uninteresting or lacked chemistry. Good thing though Yoon Shi Yoon is a good actor as well as the supporting actors, it made the story bearable. Why is it NOT until ep 40. Gosh its so frustrating! I really like the drama tho. The best. Its just .. the story seems hanging in the middle .. Its a great drama. It really tailored for Yoon Shi Yoon because of his unmatchable and exception acting skills. He is really a brilliant actor. Not to mention his sweet and charming personality. He deserves an award and will pray for this. Oh man, this is the most satisfying drama that I ever watch. Like almost every episode:D. But I feel like it\\'s missing something... Yeah it\\'s like the story and relationship for each character not ended/finished yet (don\\'t want to spoiled it)... is it because I thought it\\'s 40 episode?? Hope this drama have a season 2 lol (probably not gonna happen). Clap Clap.. i like this!!! Am I the only one feeling this way? I was enjoying it so much. I was hoping they would end the series around 40 episode. t.t This was SO rewarding in the end... I rewatched the last episode as soon as it was over (ep 32/second half of 16 depending on whether you watch as hours or half hours). I love the lead couple-YSY for pretty much all his stuff and Lee Yoo Young in Tunnel then even moreso here partly from way better chemistry/a more fun pairing than the grouchy kid in Tunnel... The final episode was so touching-both brothers played out perfectly both in their phone call that was super sweet and surely an awkward thing to film chatting with himself, sobbing and being cold with...himself with barely an outfit and hair change and bit of makeup darkening for Soo Ho, all three couples where they needed to be (all facilitated by Kang Ho-remember his warm eyes made Soo Ho\\'s gf fall more in love lol), the angel needing a new angle to rescue itself from the hell of skin sagging, ink fading, and spelling shame... And the bracelet moment... Yeah, she did a lot of crying, simpering to sobbing without much variation in appearance (the staying pretty kinds of cries), while he definitely knows more ways/styles of it, but it was all justified, and speaking of just... They brought Ahn Nae Sang in from Judge cs Judge to preside over the new Judicial Review committee member, woo!! Why did the drama end at 32 episodes? I watched this for yoon si yoon and nara. I\\'m keep falling with kang ho character ^^~ goona miss this drama when it end.. What the heck with Sang Chul, evil jerk... Hopefully So Eun could think rationally and wait for Kang Ho explanation. Those jerks should get their punishment. After watching ep. 12, the misspelled tattoo now make sense. Yasss! This ia what we want!! This drama is soo good. Yoon Si-Yoon is really a great actor. From Baker King up to this drama, Your Honor. Awesome! Where are those ppl who said that Yoon Si-Yoon is exaggerate at the beginning of the drama!!!! by the time his extraordinary talent proved itself, I’m really glad that my perfect actor proudly make them silent:) I love the lead actor the judge. He is funny but can be serious also. He has great talent and very handsome. Love this Drama! $40 episodes! This will take a few twists and turns to stretch it out so long. Enjoying every bit of this drama This drama is nice, not very dramatic and the main actor is as awesome as always. But ... I really really didn’t like the main actress, she has the same expressions, she’s too plain for everyone to call her pretty all the time . She kinda ruined it for me Amazing Drama....daebak.. I love the part wheteby Kang Ho show Lee Ho Sung the cashiers cheque and tell them he hated them and will meet park hae na in court. I keep on watching that part. this drama ost so good. drama also kinda sad. worth to watch. fun and sad but you know ill recommend this. i love nara 2nd actress as she so beautiful and she act pitiful and sad looking in this drama. she deserve to be lead in the future. yoon si yoon..what more to say..superb play. ill watch his drama anytime u ask. This drama totally owns me, YSY is really amazing, I’m surprised how he can transfer all of his feelings in that so much accurate way , he is literally a great actor??????, thank U Mr.Yoon for this interesting beautiful drama I came to this drama because of lee yo young, love her so much. The story itself is so interesting, but at first i cant stand yoon si yoon acting he looks like exageratting at anything he does. But after some episodes (4/6 maybe) i found its getting better, i dont know if i’m getting used to his acting or he improved haha but love this drama and all the cast! Hope the story will keep going well & interesting and not boring:) Oh yesterday not aired.. Nara looks gorgeous Oh my God! I just love this drama, especially Yoon Shi Yoon and Lee Yo Young, their chemistry is greater than ever. The story is beautifully written that you will understand it\\'s message to our society. I love how the director emphasizes the reality of our life in this drama, and the small details that we just let go but in fact we need to pay attention(such as emphasizing the SMILE of a real criminal when the law is on his side). It has a \"Doctor(Korean Drama)\" vibe in terms of cinematography, picture quality and story writing. I am looking forward to this drama in every aspect, the romance, the suspense and the family love. this drama is a keeper, I like it.. I love YSY... saw all of his works and I can say that he\\'s really a versatile actor but in this drama I find most of his scenes over exaggerates in KangHo\\'s facial expressions,,, but even though his character is being portrayed like that, I can\\'t help but to fall for his acting..I find it annoying but cute/funny at the same time.. hahhahahha..I can\\'t hate the guy specially when I know how hard working and how great he acts in his other projects...maybe the director or writer wants KangHo to be that kind of a character where he needs to exaggerates his facials at the top level... @HV at first, i thought this drama could lead into some serious plot after watching its trailer. but, i was mistaken and change my perspective soon after watching episode 2 for the start. yes, its a serious business that involve law enforcement and sort of thing yet still have some funny moment and a bit of romance. well, it happens to any drama. that\\'s my first impression about these drama. indeed, it have same similarities from previous drama of Switch. This is the most amaeing and interested drama, I highly recommend for someone love law drama,... I cant wait until the next episode is airing. I fell in love with Yoo si yoon in this drama, he acts 2 defferent charachter very well. And i love the chemestry between him and the female lead. I just hope for a happy ending .. The more episodes I watch, the more I come to enjoy this drama! The actors are so good, I think the leads are portraying the characters really well Yoon Shi Yoon acting is great love it. He is very versatile actor!!! So far, the script is good; better than Miss Hammurabi. Some similarities with Switch but not in a good way. What is pissing me of is the lead actor (the thug twin) with the constant and incessant comical relieves and cartoonish facial expressions. That has to be the worst thug persona and character adaptation ever. Usually he is a good actor so I am blaming this character failure on the director of this show. Salute to the writer and main actor & actress. Why are the rating so low for this AWESOME drama! I\\'m trying to see what it\\'s up against...but I can\\'t think of any other dramas....all I know is this drama is absolutely wonderful. The chemistry between the leads, the funny moments sliced in between the saddest moments, the family dynamics and traumas each character has...the corrupt and rich trash...this drama has all of it. Watched the recent episode. The emotions the actors portrayed were really good!!! The plot is also great!! It\\'s totally a different kind of law drama than any other dramas out there. The mother infuriates me. She tells her favorite son (the other son pretends to be him) that she should have given birth only to him (quite wishing she never wanted the other). The pain this brought to Kang Ho left a very deep scar in his heart from his younger years. Just as he said he wanted Gravity, a family to hold him down, his longer for love and acceptance is heart crushing to watch. I truly adore Yoon Si Yoon and his acting. I think the jaw thing is meant to be a habit since he\\'s been raised by the streets in a way. The drama\\'s intense and I\\'m dying to know the ending already! I love Kang Ho and I want a happy ending so bad Kang ho character is way more better than so ho.. seriously so ho is a bad jerk....It fun watching kang ho being a judge..fighting ..~~ I want to concentrate on the plot and the female lead, but the male lead\\'s over the top chewing up the scene over acting is too distracting and makes it hard to enjoy the show. When I watch this drama, I knew that character that Yoon Shi Yoon wants to create, what\\'s great about him, he didn\\'t afraid to look ugly or weird. And he knows not everybody who like the way he acts. If he wants to create another character, it\\'s easy for him.. He really knows what he wants. Then I remembered Jim Carrey at Ace Ventura, he makes the characters of his own, like Ysy..I didn\\'t compare both of them, but to be honest for me Ysy as an actor its really good and brave, because he didn\\'t afraid to be different.

Yoon shi yoon do a great job..His acting so amazing as Han Kang Ho... i hope it will be happy ending for their Wow! Just wow! The drama is so entertaining to watch. I\\'m at the episode 3 now and I really like the lead actor ever since the I saw him from the best hit. He did really great acting alongside Lee Se Young in that drama. Honestly, that was the best drama I\\'ve ever watched that I even re-watched it 10 times with 32 episodes every day. Because of that show, He became my idol for his signature acting. Well, as for his acting in this show, it was really great so far. I can really recognize that he is Yoon Si Yoon, because he acts differently from other actors. He has his own signature that will make you adore him. Before this drama, I have watched almost all of his drama specially the baker king. I still cannot move on from that drama even if that was a 10 year old drama. This show really makes proud of him. Best support:) and good luck. The plot is similar with Switch but I really adore Yoon Shi Yoon for the non-stop kdrama. He gives his best in acting. I really love the story , plus the lead actor is amazing!:) hope it will end successfully! great story, so refreshing. i know, the lead actor are acting so weird. but it depends how you see him as an actor. as for me it\\'s still fine. but it will be a big problem, if the lead actor act, are the same for the entire series, yeah that jaw are quite disturbing. i hope it\\'s get better. They portrayed the character just like that , loud voice with street attitude accepted like that and definitely you will love it ,, Can the lead actor\\'s jaw chill please while playing as Kang-ho, seriously, lol. what is the name of the song at the end of the ep before the preview I really don\\'t know why others keep on saying that YSY acting is over the top on this one with all his facial expressions and all?? I mean, his character has spent most of his life in jail, didn\\'t finish his school, has family issues, and a neighborhood thug,,his character didn\\'t know how to socialized with other people normally because of his circumstances,, leaving his \"thugly attitude\" out in open in public... I\\'ve watched alot of K-dramas with THUG characters on it, and most of them has the same mannerism and facial expressions as what YSY is doing in the drama... In my opinion,he is doing fine portraying his character as Kang Ho,,, Sorry i just can’t stand watching lead actor’s acting.he has weird facial expression and he is trying too hard to actualise the bad character. But anyway,it’s a nice drama. I really like this drama! Nice story. Love the lead actor! Nice drama, well written, good actors, terrible lead actor. Is he a monkey? wtf is he trying to do? is it hubris? Is it the director? Dude, stop with the grimaces, just act. Sad. why it feels like SWITCH drama... The plot is different from other legal dramas I\\'ve watched.. It tackles different angles of unjust circumstances that is happening in reality. Everyone is doing great portraying their characters specially Lee Yoo Young and Yoon Shi Yoon.. Great job Writer-nim!! Fighting donggu-yahhhhh!!! So I still remember other actors in tunnel. Lee you young who locks emotion (and now can\\'t even look at the corpse) and Heo Sung Tae as the crazy criminal (now a prosecutor) . Ironic HAHAHAHA. Still loving this drama. Han Soo-Ho works as a judge and he is guided by principles. His principal’s are screwed up since he even had his brother go to jail with his lying. I know that they are trying to make the judge twin brother not as a bad person but as a very inflexible judge who only follows the letter of the law. But it\\'s just retarded that he doesn\\'t mention the very important detail that he couldn\\'t hear anything because he was using headphones IN A RAPE CASE. This is not justice, it\\'s just stupid stubborness. watched the first 4 episodes and it was nice...can\\'t wait for next week episode! Ddabbong!!! I don\\'t know this drama has comedy lol I love this. The drama is great , THE Plot is great everything is great. The actors are portraying their role greatly. Its definitely worth a watch!!!? Han so ho so annoying, i cant stand his character.. watch this drama because of lee yo young so excited to see this!! I love Lee Yoo-Young in Tunnel, she\\'s so good.. Now she\\'s pairing up with Yoon Shi Yoon,, this will be spectacular...Both of them are great in acting!!! I\\'m looking forward to the main lead\\'s chemistry.... Soo-ho again? Why are so many dramas using Soo-ho as the main role? yoon shi yoon <3 OH YES! ANOTHER YOON SHI YOON DRAMA!? Is this another \"switch\"? Or lawless lawyer? They mispelled angle. It\\'s going to be hard to take any scenes where the tattoo is visible, seriously. oya oya oya @below comment Lol I’m quite confused about his tattoo... there’s an angel and it says angle... is this a mistake or does it really mean angle? Soooo excited!!! Can\\'t Waitttt!!11!! Copied from Switch or not I don\\'t care as long as it\\'s Yoon Shi Yoon is in mt screen...Excited so much for this drama... Donggu with Lee Yoo Young!! Switch???? that\\'s weird; this reminds me of Switch and its also from SBS Err... Switch/Defendant? Wait, He and She? Brother? eeeh Switch? it has a similar plot. @Giana @Pri: fate is called 1N2D Waaaah! Lee Yoo Young!!! I wonder why she didn\\'t take the drama with So Ji Sub. But anyway, I\\'ll watch anything with her in it. Can\\'t wait! She\\'s joo hyuk girlfriend right? what a fate,.. 1n2d feels @Diana: and... Joo Won is a member of 1N2Ds season 2 and Yoon Si Yoon ss3 I find that both Joo won and Yoon Siyoon has this kind of fate between them. First of all both actors has worked on the hit drama King of baking, then after that Joo won went on to star in the drama Bridal Mask with Jin Seyeon, then now Siyoon was recently paired up with JSY in Grand prince. Then Joo won went on to star in Good doctor alongside Joo Sang wook n now Siyoon has worked with JSW in Grand Prince. Then now Siyoon is working with Lee Yoo Young, who also acted with Joo won in the movie Fatal Intuition lol. There\\'s seriously too many coincidences between them I\\'m very curius why Lee YoonYoung chose this drama instead of accepting the role in So Ji Sub drama. Well I guess the story isn\\'t as simple as the synopsis says. I once got trick (in a good way) by the synopsis of The Best Hit when it was announced since the original story is not as simple as the first hint of the plot. Will it happen again? I\\'ve been waiting for the lead actress to be announced and finally she\\'s here!!! I do not like this genre but I will watch it because of Yoon Si Yoon and Lee Yoo Young. Although Dong Gu and Gutaeng hyung did not join 1N2Ds together, they still have a little fate, right? Lee Yoo Young & Yoon Si-Yoon!!! This is going to be epic. I can\\'t wait. I read it\\'s the actress Lee Yoo Young (Tunnel) who will be the lead. Oh my Please cast these actress, I watch everything YSY is in, but...it is a bit soon to repeat Switch\\'s theme, isn\\'t it? Judge, prosecutor... Not different enough and just being twins vs doppelgangers isn\\'t a huge difference, either... Switch\\'s big diff is just that the con man only got caught at the very end while this one was arrested 6*... Just a bit sad for such a talented actor. I hope its vibe is different enough to give it distinction but after Grand Prince had such great actors as princes but lousy writing, it seems his agency is just giving up when his talent is immense! Kang sora please Yehh ... Yoona Snsd please!!! Park So Dam!!! please please please Yoona please as female lead;) Park Jin Joo i want her as main park bo young for female lead please. I bet they look adorable together pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee. han hyo jo for the female lead ... jebal jebal I don\\'t get this eagerness of SBS with producing same legal drama over and over with different stars. Jeon So Min for the Leads pleaasee Whoever the leads, but no idol please. Choi soo young snsd ..pleaseee Is it me or the synopsis is the same as switch on sbs? I mean prosecutor to judge... c\\'mon guys Jung hye sung for female lead Kim go Eun will be the female lead. Please she deserves new drama. But it\\'s ok if it\\'s not her,I agree if another female lead will be play. Park bo young will be good match. Jung hye sung for.... Pleaseee Kim seulgi or yoon so hi for lead female role. Kim go Eun please. I really like her. Can\\'t wait to see the main lead actors Kim go Eun please. I really like her. Can\\'t wait to know the lead actors. If shown July same as TIME (mbc), the male lead have the same name? Soo ho. And i saw somewhere also, Lee Yi Kyung (waikiki actor) new drama his name is Soo ho. Whats with that name???? Ahahaha Jo Bo Ah for female lead, please!!! Han hyo joo for female lead.. or yuri .. moon chae won already accept diff role.. Chae Soo Bin for the female lead please!!! I know that this is impossible but if Donggu will accept the role, I hope Lee Se Young will be the female lead. Or maybe Kim Go Eun. I hope YSY will take this project!!! he\\'s such a versatile actor,, oooooh i like oppa just finshed watching grand prince loved it .. lee se young for the lead female role fighting Yang Se Jong will be perfect lead here! moon chae won for lead actres..:) Please Kim go Eun for the female lead. Her acting is really good. Uhm Ki Joon and Uhm Hyun Kyung please Park so dam for female lead role please Park so dam please',\n",

       "  'comments': 'I enjoyed to watch this drama.. I love Han Ji Min since Miss Baek and started to watch back all her dramas. I must say, this \"back to the future\" plot is almost perfect except 1 thing. Ji Min voice is too old even when she backs to her youth. I love the cast especially Ji sung and Ji min..They are so good ..and this movie has a lot of lessons!!!..Much love ..from Nigeria I think this drama was kind of pointless - the male lead is only spoiled to get what he wants without the effort to actually make changes in his life. The thing that bothers me the most is when he traveled to the past and only missed his sons a little and forgets about them for the rest of the series. No wonder the wife became such a loony. As compared to Go Back Couple, this series was a total drag. as expected plot about \\'time\\' always success to make me immerse in the story. well im quite a logical man whos love to watch drama though there are always a scene in every drama that way to unlogical for me and bother me to immerse in the story and make me stop watched it but this one is different, i can really enjoy it till the end, i dont know why but it feels so real and there are so many life lesson u can get. this is the best drama for me so far. and now i fell in love with han ji min, i mean that smile she has really make me melt. for those who have so many regret in their life this drama really really worth to watch, i mean it! still watching it on ep 3, but actually i have been interested since jimin and hana take roles also the man main role is very good actor. he also took a role in innocent defendant if im not mistaken and i kinda like his act. so basically this drama i like this drama from the start but despite the actor and the actress which i like from the beginning, i think this drama worth to watch cause it has good plot about young marriage couple life well i know there are many other drama with this kind of plot but still im impress with this drama and u guys should watch it! especially for those young couples out there whos might having a hard time. This drama is so good... There are a lot of lessons. Boys need to watch this thoo. Sometimes man kept blaming women because of their changes but man never care about women reasons to changes Miss this drama sooooo much. Some scenes mirrored my experience. Laugh hard when CJH com turned off (Ji Sung\\'s expression/acting was priceless). Small details of the drama were all diamonds. Han Ji Min did a superb acting too! I feel every emotion she displayed. Both main leads were in sync in their performance. Indeed! HJM has the best chemistry with Ji Sung among the actors she worked with. All the actors did an amazing job. The people behind were all awesome. , The cinematography was great. The story was relatable. Kodus to all of you! I’m afraid I don’t like the premise of this story...this is much different than the “Go Back Couple”... In that story, they tried to change their lives separately knowing their “history” together. In this one, he is actually married to someone else, everything is erased and she’s single with no one else. How is this a good story? What right does he have to interfere in her life? He doesn’t want her but doesn’t want her to be with anyone else either? She is no better by coming on to a married man since day one. You end up just being disgusted by the couple. She was horrible when they were married because she really couldn’t communicate or control her anger. He was a selfish dummy who took no responsibilty for the relationship. In the new timeline, she’s a homewrecker and he’s still selfish. Booo!! Go back couple is way better! They tried to make the new wife spoiled and selfish but that’s not the point...she’s barely there and so inconsequential. She could have been anyone. Love this drama.. i miss them so much I love this movie! In fact how I which it was really possible to have time travel. I love Han Ji-Mi role and how well she interpreted it. Kudos to all the actors/actresses in his movie. Production crew, you really did a nice work. Anticipating more interesting movie from you all. From Nigeria I so much love this drama. I mean ive been watching so much kdramas but this is defferent. I like the seo woo jin character so much, i want to be like her, a very understandable wife. And i would love too if my husband is like cha joo hyuk. Waaah, what a dream life would come true. Thank you for this wonderful drama guys ❤ It\\'s been quite long since I watch drama that both lead actors give a superb acting performance. Make casual cute/touching of the story feels memorable. I seldomly watch K-drama but dunno how I managed to get hooked onto this series. I love it and could relate to it easily. The actors were brilliant especially Seo woo jin and her mom. I was hoping that after ep 14 they would warp back to their initial life as payback for their time travels and had to work out their marriage from there, now that they had learnt their lessons. But, I guess the ending was fine also. And I was hoping they would solve the time travel mystery, the beggar actual identity and how seo woo jin’s mom knew him during the first time travel. Otherwise, really satisfied that I’d followed this series and hopefully there’ll be more like this i was so sad when it ended. Like i’m torn between wanting a season 2 or just rewatching the series again. Such a brilliant cast + amazing storyline + how the characters develop overtime. If anything involves Ji sung or Han Ji Min, you know you’re definitely in for a good ride. Its not easy for me to cry when it comes to seeing a man crying but Ji sung really made me cry when he kneeled down in from of Ji Min ahhhhhhh. Their chemistry is blowing too I cant believe they top my fav couple Hwang jung eum x ji sung It has been rare for a drama produced, values and glorifies marital relationship as a subject. It’s a simple story but relatable to many. Great chemistry Ji sung with Ji min. Well, anyway any chemistry between Ji sung with other lead are also great! I\\'m not a kind of time travel genre. But, everything comes out from Ji sung is so great! He never makes us fail or doesn\\'t feel worth for watching his dramas. Maybe we should call his sincere acting for life:) Good closing aka ending. TQ FW team! from scripts (normal hard working people), storyline & OST (which lead me to N.Flying). The chemistry btwn ji sung & ji min is superb! Ji Sung\\'s drama never fails. All actors played their role well too. Worth watching! Just finished this drama and i just want to say this drama is highly recommended!! Everything is just perfect, from the cast , soundtrack , story plot is soooo damn good!!!. You guys must to watch drama. Once again, Jisung\\'s drama never dissapoint me? I watch this only bcs of han ji min, so happy to see her again.. ji sung and jimin are the gusts from 3 meals a day, i thought I\\'d be seeing lee seo jin as cameo, like he\\'s as angry kcu bank customer lol... so more and more time travel ideas for kdramas lately, either you chase a criminal or can\\'t stand your wife, there\\'s always a room to get a second chance using time travel, well it\\'s quite interesting.. it\\'s an okay drama, light, fun, with real good chemistry among ji sung and ji min. How on earth ji min is still that pretty, she can play as high school student and still nailed it.. Thank you for the sweet memories! I love all of you guys!!!<3333 one of the best this season!! Jisung and HanJiMin beautiful chemistry loved it all the way!! Ji Sung and Han Ji Min have a great chemistry in this drama!!! Just finished the final episode. I feel it was so short. I will miss Familiar Wife!!!! Thank you to all the cast, you did a great job. I just finished watching Ep.16... Beautiful, really. I thank all the actors and the whole film team for the excellent work and hearts they have put into this drama. Han Ji-Min and Ji Sung, the central pair, just confirmed their super level and exellently led the series... Thank you very much. This drama he is ranked among one of my most favorite ... Though similar at first to “Go Back Couple”, that is only superficially: this series is more mature, poignant, sad, and joyous. As usual Ji Sung takes a narrative and gives both humor and grace that keeps the viewer focused far more intimately than most actors can achieve. His beauty and depth are mesmerizing. And when you hit ep. 8, you know this is special. However, that is the height of the series, and the rest is mostly standard: good not great, especially for Ji Sung. waited for new ep every weekend and it was ended today...beautiful drama...great chemistry among the cast...deserved on 1st ranked..unrivalled from 1st ep...credit to people who are working hard on sub and drama website so we can rewatch anytime...the drama is such a treasure keeping in myself...\"Familiar Wife\" did very well...jal haess-eo! The chemistry between Jisung and Hanjimin is too perfect<3 They all did a really good job, loving this drama so far. Thanks for the sweet memories? While i watched 1st episode, i felt this drama quite similar with Go Back Couple. This drama has played with my emotions so much, I can cry buckets of tears, I love this drama so much and it’s been so long since I watched a drama this good Learn so much things from this drama, cant wait for the last episode. Damn I can\\'t to watch ep15 & 16?? I really love this drama. i love this show. it gets better with every episode. and this proven with the ratings. you will fall in love with the characters in the show. Familiar Wife.... .thanks a lot for you\\'d became a part of my life for 3 months. You made me laugh and cry. I\\'m not married, yet I felt every emotions that each actors/ actresses portrayed. The warmth you\\'ve showed is DAEBAKKK.....!!!You are one of the best dramas i\\'ve watched. Sarangeyoooo....Familiar Wife!!!! The drama is interesting everyone should watch it. It was nice, korean drama will always be niced to see even though this drama is underrated, it still the best drama i ever watched;) Why Woo-jin too aggressive and wild? Where is Hye-Won? She was married to Joo-Hyuk too. This drama reminds me of Haruki Murakami\\'s 1Q84 DAEBAK <3 <3 <3 One of the best Kdrama in 2018 or even of all dramas i\\'d watched.... OMG...I\\'ve just watched episode 12 of this series and i have to say that this drama is a MUST WATCH!!!...it\\'s the best kdrama of all the times. Han Ji Min is a great actress and Ji Sung as well so there was no doubt that this drama will be a DAEBAK but after watching this I have to say that the scriptwriter is a genius...the action is so unpredictable and the characters does the opposite of everything that I had assumed that they would...but in a good way...so I have soo much fun watching it. I totally love this drama and I wanna see more projects of her( I\\'ve already watched Oh my ghost, Weightlifting fairy Kim Bok Joo and High school king but I\\'m waiting for more ^^) so Yang Hee-Seung-sshi fighting!~~^^ Imo, this drama is wayy better than what\\'s wrong with secretary kim. Shame that it is not that popular. Best drama in 2018 incoming!!! 11 and 12 Kinda boring. Not as good as first episode. OMG this drama is getting more interesting and interesting each episode! Can\\'t wait for episode 13 OMG!!!!!!! Well, I admit that at first I thought the premise of this drama was a bit meh because it was just too \"fantasy\" for me, but who knew that this actually gets my attention real hard. Ji Sung really never fails me. I really love him. His crying scene always hurts my heart! He is so good with acting. I guarantee that starting from episode 13 it will be a hell of a ride until the end of this drama. The writer knows how to squeeze your heart! I love this drama and OSTs from Roy Kim and John Park is a PLUS! It really is a life lesson drama. The drama was overall okay but i hate that they put the blame only to the husband for what happened in the previous life. I mean, they both has their own share of accountability of what happened. The wife was a very terrible wife in the previous life and tbh the husband is a relatively a normal kind of husband (i guess). I mean he was definitely not a good husband,but not a bad one. He did not cheat, he treats his wife and kids well. In the other hand, I think the wife is a really terrible wife in the sense that she treats her husband without respect at all and also does not care for the husband at all. Dont get me wrong, i just hate the fact that the husband was portrayed to be in a very big sin, and that what happened to the wife was ALL the husband\\'s fault. It also does not make any sense that the wife was able to get the degree in the new life, while fail in the old life. I mean, come on! That shouldn\\'t be the husband\\'s fault too right? If anything, the husband should be helping for that to happend because he is her tutor, right. Whatever. Haha. I guess I think wayyý too much watching this drama. Lol Jisung just wont let you down ,. even though im a fan of him i still pick stuff i want to watch and when i saw the premise of this,. i was like nah pass!! but read some comments and thought maybe ill give it a try and damn the interactions between the 2 main leads is just gold ,. if this would end like you would wish it would be definitely be one of my fav kdramas!! Best drama of all time<3 SPOILERS!!! OMG...I absolutely love the writer of this drama. These veteran actors deliver their emotions flawlessly. Episode 11 had me in tears because I felt of Seo Woo Jin\\'s emotions as if they were my own. The story is not predictable and keeps me guessing. The characters does the opposite of everything that I had assumed that they would be doing including Lee Hye Won. She surprised me in this episode in how she handled herself with that young man and her husband. This is going to go on my list as a Top and Favorite drama. After all what should I expect from a Ji Sung drama but the best. He is my top 3 favorite south korean actors. Whenever i see a Ji Sung drama, I already know that its going to be good regardless of ratings. This man is a genius...Seranghae as a fan. Ji Sung.....I love your Wife\\'s Lee Bo-Young\\'s acting also....Fighting???? This is A MUST WATCH drama! Funny reading at the comments everywhere at how pissed ppl are about the drama’s plot. Yes they are both cheating on their current partners but i feel only the minority of us that sees that truly the writer main concept is showing true, fated love. The one person that is meant for you. Soulmate? No matter how much he tried to change his fate, one thing seems to not change and never will, Woojin’s deep rooted feelings for Joo Hyuk:’) I love this drama so much. I love this drama.. It is very realistic about marriage being torn apart and exhausted and forget all the promises beacause of all the rush in life. I like this drama. It\\'s all there. Excellent acting cast and exellent master pair by Han Ji-Min and Ji Sung. They are beautiful together. Looking forward to the next episodes:) wow i like drama I love when I am looking for something good to be watched and I can find a treasure like this one. I had to stop what I was doing in order to watch Familiar Wife, and I don\\'t regret. I can\\'t wait for the next episodes. Ji Sung must stop making me cry ^^ Sometimes kdramas get too complicated and the plot ends up being unnecessarily difficult to understand. This is just the beautiful and meaningful light hearted drama you can enjoy! this drama is daebaaaaaaak Amidst the great dramas (and there were not many great ones just a selected few excellent ones) aired this year, I’m confident enough to say this is one of the best one for 2018 alone. Starting from its casts to the plot and storyline, I love how relatable this drama is to our reality. It feels us viewers can definitely relate to it be it we are married currently or not. We all make stupid decisions in life thinking its really the best for us. Sometimes, we fail to see the gem thats already in front of us. The grass too isnt always greener on the other side. This drama makes me emotional, just like how Because this is my first life did to me previously. It felt so real, like I know its definitely happening outside to someone...... And I love drama thats realistic. Kudos to Familiar Wife and its cast for reviving my faith in kdramas. I’m not one that watch cliche, straight to the point, you-can-predict-what-happens-next romance. A rich guy with a normal girl etc lol. In the recent episode, I’d thought we’d see more of Joo Hyuk dwelling over the past and his mistake but nope he didnt. In fact he did something I didnt expect him to do. Like trying his best to get over Woo Jin........ This drama portrays the reality thats happening right now, about marriage and life. Pretty much got me hooked since the 1st episode. Yes I got into this because of the cast itself. Just knowing Han Jimin & Jisung themselves is the main lead, I already knew I’m in for a good ride. So far this is the best (considering the first half of 2018 kdrama was not IT for me) I love dramas like these. The vibes, filmography. TVN never fails to air drama that is always my favs <3 I know where this drama is heading to but I really hope they will let Woojin and Joog Hoo to be a real couple for a while at least let them kiss and do \"things\" that couples do? I really like Woojin and Jong Hoo together they\\'re so cute. The husband is a selfish person he left her and the kids without any hesitation so that he can go to his current wife and now he wants to his old life with Woojin?! Hell no! And he has caused so much loss for other people around him. reminds me of go back couple. love this series! I\\'m completely hooked!!!!!!! Daebak!!!! wow! nice! love all the casts down to the security guard. great chemistry between leads and they totally nailed their part. not too often to see this kind of work. i\\'m 100% hooked! Can we just applaud Han Ji Min for delivering her part so naturally? Every facial expression and the way she delivers her line is soo on point. I felt like I am the one who falls in love with her in this drama. Not forgetting Ji Sung as well..such a perfect pair! It was kinda sad seeing the part where he didn\\'t comfort Woojin. Joohyuk was incredibly selfish and I am glad he finally realised that. So now, if Joohyuk tries to change his past again, he must do everything right in order to get his old life back. But I feel like he will do something wrong and something will also be different once he gets back to the future again. Ahh this drama is so good 100/100 recommended!! student seo woo jin reaaally looks like sung shi won from Reply 1997 <3 my favourite actor is back. ...yay! ji sung Shi I love you and the way you deliver your lines well. you portray your characters so well it is so different from go back couple.this drama started to get really exciting. cant wait for this week episode. the mother recognize her son-in-law! fighting Ji Sung my favourite actor! glad that he takes this role after an intense role in the defendant! He\\'s going to realise he still has feelings for his wife and wish to go back and make things right with his wife and kids or else his friend will get married to his wife in his very own eyes. The choice is his\\' I understand where this story is heading to. I\\'ll just keep my fingers crossed This drama is progressing, can\\'t wait to see how the story unfolds, he\\'s beginning to fall in love with his wife again and he\\'s jelous because his friend is interested in her. His new wife seems to be the worst, shes not just selfish but she lacks respect & dosent care about his parent and she flirts. There is a saying that \" the devil u know is better than the angel u don\\'t know\" This like go back couple but with like new modification This drama remind me of NCT U \\' s song \" Timeless\" and when i went to hear the song again, the lyrics was the perfect fit with the story so far.. wooooahh..daebak..great kdrama...very nice story..recommended!!! uwaa it\\'s so interesting! Ji Sung and Jang Seung Jo, well done!!! I\\'m watching this drama because of Ji Sung and Jang Seung Jo. Keep up the good job. well done! ??? The rating tho!!! WOWOOWOWOW More like The Family Man with Nicolas Cage and Tea Leoni I love the story line!! At first i thought this is same with ‘go back couple’ but after ep 2 woww i love the plot.. lol he mus fell in love with woo jin back and regret it ... @ li, think he cared less to his wife. Just my opinion. Seo woo jin is at fault too. They both are poor in communicating. They both have their own selfish ways. and i think both have just lost the spark which is common to couples who fall Out of love.can\\'t blame him though. And it wold be impossible if theyll Back in each other\\'s arms in the end. what he choose is unforgiving no matter how wrong Seo woo join was. @jessie, her husband is caring, she is the one not being caring for him, she doesn\\'t cook and always raising her voice on him. I understand they are both busy but he is busier. She sent him out in the rain, thats too mean.They should have had just one baby if they knew they were facing challenges. If she had been good to him he wouldn\\'t regret marrying her and he wouldn\\'t wish he had married kang ha na even if he had a crush on her. First I thought it had Go Back Couple vibe. But after ep 2, it had Manhole vibe. But I still love it bec of ji sung @ li, i think the story is based on the reality of every ordinary people. Seo Woo Jin is a reflection of a woman who have lost her grace and charm maybe because of her uncaring husband, the struggling time she has for herself, for her children, for her mother, and her work. many people especially women can relate to this genre. Some are fortunate maybe because they know how to balance their life and the financial status is a plus. But many are not i see many of them are struggling wanting to go back in time \\'only if\\'. Can\\'t wait to see what happens next. Am guessing kang hana replaced his wife,and she will be the one giving him troubles and han ji min will be the loving woman he wished he had married. I guess their fate interchanged. Kang hana is prettier What\\'s her problem, why is she soo mean to her husband. She annoys me. Guess he married his wife out of pity because she lost her dad, why do they do that. And why did she suddenly change towards him, I tot she was the one who liked him first & asked him out. They making it look as if marriage is a living hell. Enjoying the drama, but Ji Sung looks way too old to be playing a college student... Makes it hard to watch—as great an actor he is. looks like go back couple but also more likely to manhole butterfly effect? So far very good....ji sung is amazing as always. @Aj, the flashback from high school is just a couple of minutes....the story revolves on the present day. how the two live without each others company. the twist has already just begun. don\\'t easily judge on just a few things you\\'ve seen or heard. and to everyone who love this drama....congratulations! they just made it to the top. i am full of excitement since the two leads accepted the drama and a big bonus though that Koreans choose dramas that evolves around ordinary people. the idea is the same as go back couple: marriage life, couple quarrel, time slip. but sure it\\'s different. i\\'m still watching this and i think i\\'ll keep watching this drama. it\\'s so interesting. After watching episode 1 it is 98% another Go Back Couple but i love the cast here better To those people who are saying that this drama is the same as Go back couple, Pls watch episode 2 and you will realize that this drama is entirely different. Dont judge the book by its cover and in fact it has a good ratings so far Ji Sung, natural acting, keep it that way. Please does anyone know the name of the musical piece Kang Han-Na played? It was also played in another kdrama but I can\\'t remember which one and it\\'s driving me nuts!! I love this drama just by watching first ep.......it is so perfect and i cannot stop laughing cause it\\'s so funny I cannot imagine why the brilliant Ji Sung is in a tiresome flash back to high school drama: what was he thinking. It’s been done to death as recently as just last year in Go Back Couple. And this one begins with a boring, tedious first episode. Ugh. I’ll pass on the rest, which I have never done with Ji Sung before. Haven\\'t watch go back couple. And don\\'t have plans to watch to. May it similar or not I\\'m hooked with main leads portrayals in familiar wife. It\\'s not usual to watch this kind of drama and one big ball of casts all in one project. I salute they all deliver their lines incredibly. the storyline is similar with japanese drama Disappointing Drama 2015.. This drama REALLY reminds me of Go Back Couple. Similar plot, different leads. Wow!Amazing Drama I will watch it because of Ji sung Kang Han Na???? i dont care if its another go back couple or not, cuz i really want more of that!!! Best trailer. Han ji min is at her best again. She can portray anything. Very versatile indeed. Hi sung is just flawless. Lovin the tandem. can\\'t wait!! Similar to go back couple drama .. . but will try Another Go Back Couple but I\\'ll definitely watch it i hope that it isn\\'t another (go back couple) omg! finally! i miss ji sung acted in romances comedy drama!!! he is such a talented person and i hope he have such a good chemistry with ha ji min! looking forward for this drama <3 Excited to see actor Hakyeon!!! This drama reminds me of ‘Miracle that we met’ but I’m looking forward to FW take though and @ Marinanana HJM’s co lead in ‘Padam Padam’ was Jung Woo Sung if this is who you are referring to. Can’t wait to see this couple. Always get mesmerized by Jisung’s acting. All the best for this new drama! ^^ what a charismatic beautiful couple they make!

       "  'comments': 'I Love This Series watch while you still have the chance @NS ikr!! I have a hard time watching things like this..I get soo upset and or angry. I can\\'t stand Umine what she has done to Ayumi. It\\'s not like Ayumi was a mean cute popular girl. Which they are usually mean and selfish when they are cute and popular.. But she was soo sweet. To see this happen to her is extremely upsetting.. and I assume by the comments that ppl are leaving that at the end she decides to stay in Kagas body.. The moral is you can be beautiful on the outside and still be a horrible person on the inside. O and those cheek pinches looked so painful! Omfgggg this Series are beautiful? i love iz so damn much When you watch this series on netflix, dont miss the post credit scene! I laughed so hard during that scene.? It was my first japanese drama and it was quite good. I fell in love with Kaga <3, but I don’t like the end though. The music is good and catchy, and the characters are interesting too. I read the manga.. it pretty nice and amazing plot.. hope this live action also good 10/10 would recommend! Would love to have a season 2 though>.< I don\\'t like the ending T_T well done for a series with 6 episodes nevertheless Kaga-kun looks like young yamapi!!!! <3 Dyck Khero-kun...Kaga-kun is the night, champion, bff, best love interest of 2018...and I challenge to a official duel (just know I\\'m 6 feet tall,built like Xena and not afraid of squashing you with my giant tits???? Its kinda good! <3 Is this a ongoing series? I really love it I just started watching!! is it an on-going series or already done? im just about to start watching it >< is there any way to buy this series, i really love it Loved this but the end left me heartbroken!!! I saw the fanvid and downloaded Netflix just for this.. and it was amazing. All of the main casts are good at portraying their characters. I don’t usually like body-switching drama but this is one of a kind. I watched it many times, can never get bored with Kaga! But the real ending is the one that surprised me a lot, coz I never knew there was continuation after the ending credit until I rewatched it and decided to the the ending song by Johnny’s WEST. And I LOVE the ending. めっちゃ 好きやねん(^-^) At first i thought it would be an ordinary teen series but i was wrong. As i finish every episode, i get all those butterflies in my stomach to watch the next episode. Great plot and great actors! Hands down to the actors because they can portray every chracteristics of the characters. Would recommend to y\\'all! I rate this as 10/10? @Rachel I actually haven\\'t watched the show myself but are you referring to Akatsuki by Johnny\\'s West (the two male leads are members of the group and I know they sing the theme or ending or something like that) Hello everyone, the beautiful soundtrack is by Ken Arai on the Japan Itunes store. Album name is 宇宙を駆けるよだか-オリジナルサウンドトラック @Rachel I don\\'t know if this is the ending credits song but the last song of the album is \"Stay in My Heart\". @Rachel: It\\'s Akatsuki by Johnny\\'s West Anybody know the name of the ending credits song? I cant find it anywhere but I really love it. great acting for all the casts! Anyone know that song that plays during the scene of Kaga asking Ayumi who she seriously is in love with in the last ep? I finished this almost a week ago, yet I still think about it a lot. It was so beautifully written, and I was on the verge of crying. I want to see more of the characters\\' lives go on, and I wish that Ayumi stayed with Kaga, but we\\'ll see. Beautiful show, but a bit bothered by Ayumi\\'s decision at the end of the series. I binge watched this. Didn’t intend to. Every time I thought it was getting corny..I was wrong. Nothing is as it seems. Well written. ayumi should have stayed with kaga, beautiful show i hope you can do a 2nd season soon <3 cheers from Chile Epic! The plot, the storyline and even the concept of how they changed bodies are mind-boggling. Kudos to the actors to for having to play more than one character and they really acted it all spot on!! Honestly I watched it all about a week and half ago on Netflix I didnt really think it was gonna be anything special but boi was I wrong on so many levels I was blown away by the actors performances and I love how they highlight and a subject that is not very discussed in Japanese society so it was really brilliant see the diversity of the characters and how people can see beneath the looks and really except you for who you are as a person phenomenal series I hope they do another season because it was amazing This was.....amazing! It was so good, I cried through alot of it and balled like a baby at the end. Thank you to the writers and the actors, bravo! Only on episode 3 but I can’t get over this - lol never thought i would fall in love with the show and cant wait for more, rate this 100000/10 I loved the series I hope they do season 2!! I love how the series shows that no matter what you look like, even swapping bodies with someone, your personality and feelings will never change. I feel for Kaga... His love for Ayumi is selflless... I tried watching other Jdrama and live actions but the overreacting characters always got me. This one was simply amazing, it lacks nothing and you can relate to one of the characters. Emotions, Suspense, Plot twists; This was a whole Netflix night in heaven Honestly definitely recommend! Binge watched it all night and slept at 4 am , def worth it! The actors are amazing and the plot is just overwhelmingly amazing . Kaga deserved better lorddd Why is it rated tv ma? I started this curious about how it would unfold and I finished it at 2 am. It was so good. The actors are amazing the story has an authenticity that holds you and - pulls you in. Pretty much everyone knows what it’s like to not be pretty at some point in their life, to feel alone, unloved but it’s what you do with who you are that brings out your best or worst. At one point it hit me that the girl who is now in the “ugly” girls body would bring that unattractive person to a whole new level of beauty because she has so much love for herself and others. And after a while of being her, she became so freakin cute. The plot was excellent -Everyone was spot on and I give it a 10 out of 10. I was thoroughly impressed. I loved this series but I was soooo upset that poor Kaga didn’t benefit at all!? This series brought up a touchy subject regarding bullying and suicide but brought awareness in a way. I binged on this one for sure. Great acting and a great cast. I would definitely have this as a must see! Got hooked and finished all episodes in one night. There goes my sleep lol It\\'s like looking into a remake of Nobuta but mixed with Magic. the casts are amazing. their acting are on point. WHAT AN AMAZING DRAMA!!!!!! damn this drama was so good, im shook Season Two Please? I didn\\'t know what to expect of the show until I actually watched it. The story itself is amazing, and all the actors did an amazing job. Would 100% recommend. Loving.this.show.goddamnnn what is at the end credits song (really last song) of “Switched” Japanese drama on Netflix? It reminds me of the anime kimi ni todoke/ from me to you I want a second season I saw a movie quite similar to this way way back. I am not so sure if it was korean or japanese since it was so random that I saw it about 14-15years ago, if I remember it correctly. I have been searching for that movie up until now I cant find it. Lol! I loved this series:) I really loved Daiki Shigeoka ❤️ his smile? personality and such a wonderful friend. I’m so disappointed tho! How can you not pick him?

       "  'comments': \"stan loona I’m obsessed with this drama, I cannot stop thinking about it (especially Kijima's gazes OMG)!!!I did not like the end at all though, that literally hurt to watch, it just felt too unfair and open-ended. People hate the manga ending but that was even better. Everything else before the ending is 10/10, one of the best yaoi manga live adaptations I have ever seen. Also one of the most sensual and classy BL mangas I’ve seen so far. I was so enveloped in it, I can’t stop thinking about it. Supposedly this was supposed to be 10 episodes and was cut. I want to buy the blu-day to show my support. Holy Sh*t This is Unbelievably Awesome Just finished the drama without subtitle, I will watch it again later with subtitle. The plot, the genre and the fact that it was adapted from a Yaoi manga, the drama can easily turned into a cringey, low-quality, bad acted one. But luckily it is not. From the directing, story-writing, cinematography, soundtracks and the acting, it is surprisingly of higher quality, given the limited time slot and overall budgeted production. It's a very thoughtful adaptation from the original manga, in fact I thought the characters are more fleshed out in this live action version. The acting from both main actors (and even 1 supporting chara) are very subtle, just right. No over-acting or awkwardness between them. Glad I gave this drama a try, worth the wait for the past 6 weeks. The problem though, 6 episodes are just too short. Three episodes so far and surprisingly it's soo good!!! lead actors are freakin cute......acting is way better than other japanese bl........plot is new and interesting..series is so hot...great one....loved everything about it....\",\n",

       "  'comments': 'Such a stuck in the ending of voice 2, so I wish voice 3 will ready soon, and please bring back our moo jin hyuk (jang hyuk) and hyun ho (yesung) and i so wish there kind of psycho like moo tae gu (kim jae wook), i curious to see colab from jinwook and janghyuk.. Absolutely loved it. I think that Kang-woo had been framed for many times, for crimes committed by the actual murderer. the murderer exploits Kang-woo\\'s psychological weakness to make people around confused, even for Kang-woo himself. big possibility Kang-woo is the key to the murder case of Miho, a key witness. This season is pretty good, I like the introduction of the new character because there\\'s so much more to watch about him. The emergency cases for this season are all good and anticipating. If you haven\\'t watched season 1, you don\\'t have to bc the story of this season doesn\\'t contain anything from the last season except for some mentions of the old character. I think it was like the movie of Liam Neeson \"Unknown\" where he cant remember that he was one of the bad guys. Just like the old man said at the end that Kosuke will come back to them. I can imagine now what the season 3 would look like. Lee jin wook was awesome. I really didn\\'t miss jang hyuk but I wished he was there. I missed the hacker of voice1 Can someone tell me why Jang Kyung Hak get killed? What kind of relationship does he have with Bang Je Soo? I agree with Ran\\'s comment that 3 of them will reunited, i hope kang center still alive, and Jang Hyuk come back (because all of this mess lmao). Lol imagine about Moo Jin Hyuk and Do Kang Woo being explosive or yelling full of anger at each other??? Very amazing actor the drama is very unexpected i cant wait for season 3 am dying for it? i recommend the drama for all my friends its great? BS: in 10th episode Kang Woo tell that his brother are killed by anti-korean peoples in Japan after his father killed Miho, and i don\\'t understand how can his father still alive after death coz capital punishment based on Kang Woo told in 10th episode... Oh my oh my there\\'s a season 3. I just can\\'t! I hope female lead is alive and Jang Hyuk will go back so the three of them will be reunited! I\\'m so hooked at this thriller drama, it keeps me watching for more. I like these kind of dramas because I get bored easily on romcoms idk why. I feel like I\\'m a psychopath too with no romantic feelings LOL SPOILERS! I have no idea but anyone same mind with me that kang center is the girl, kosuke\\'s friend from japan?? This will great in voice 3... i very like this drama........ wowww after season 1 , i already falling love with season 2!!! i like do kang woo too and i hope the third season, moo jin hyuk do kang woo and kang center will be reunited. and i hope there are more scene which more intense than before the ending was a shock to me, but I really like this season. I think they will bring the main lead of season one and yesung in season 3 . anyways I highly recommend this drama. Spoiler Why This story half? Where is ending of This drama . Oh god i will waiting for more episode and more seasons:) Let kang kwonjoo,do kangwoo and moo Jinhyuk meet,it\\'ll be punch up SPOILER ALERT...do not read if you haven\\'t watched Ep 3 yet! Hoping for season 3 with Bong Tae Gyu as the villain please.... @Gyuri her name is Ryu Yeri, she was a contestant from Korea\\'s Next Top Model Season 4 Why only 12 episodes? Voice 2 is such a good drama series. Please bring back Season 3 That was truly the most terrible ending I’ve ever watched. Thanks fr wasting my goddamn time. Anyone know who is the actress who helped Bang Jesoo as the restaurant owner? Do kangwoo tears is my weak. OMG! I can\\'t wait for the 3rd season already! Just a thought though, would they bring back Moo Jin Hyuk to help Do Kang Woo? I would be a great collab! Please bring Shin Sung-Rok as villain in the third season. Director Kang oh no.. why? .... who will be the next leading lady, Park? Does she have hearing ability as good as Kang? Can’t wait for Voice 3. Can\\'t wait for the season 3, OMG what happen with kang center i hope she in season 3 too OMG that ending!! I wasn\\'t expecting this drama to be this short.may be we will be getting season 3 for the drama,the ending was a cliffhanger.hope to see the same team for season 3...and I really hope centre director isn\\'t dead... Wtf the ending. Damn... I cant wait for voice 3.. Great drama if Lee Ha Na dies (in the drama) the tittle of the drama shouldn\\'t be voice anymore,, i really hope she is in Season 3 cast? the ending?? wth????? Contain SPOILER!!!: Hope director kang survived. Exciting to see voice 3. Hope mr jang hyuk will join the season 3 after what happen to director kang. I will really great show to watch. Full force. Director kang pls be alive wait!! originally, it was 16 episodes but why only 12 now? what happened? is there any season 3 with both team leaders as cast?! Really END? Daebak!! T^T I\\'m excited for VOICE 3.... I hope it will be aired soon...... but the ending in voice 2 made me think of how it will voice again if Kang Kwon Joo died? what\\'s up with the ending, is she dead or alive, please don\\'t let her die, and who is the man backing bang je soo, hope there is season 3, there are questions that need to be answered, I\\'m sure bang je soo alone won\\'t be able to pull off this hold operation by himself, there is that mysterious guy backing him up. The ending of this season really broke my heart in to pieces? I can\\'t oml. I almost cried. The ending was so sad. Of course the character (s) I love have to... ughhhhhh What is this ending???? I really love this series/drama from season 1 and present drama. Episode 11 is so very intense.From stuffs, director, actresses and actors you did a great job . I hope there\\'s a season 3 with Mr. Jang Hyuk, and the cast of season 2. One of the best kdramas out there. Too bad that is too short. You won\\'t regret watching this. It was one of the best korean series. Great dramaa... waiting for ep10 It is not the same without Jang Hyuk. Jang hyuk is a more seasoned actor, and was better character for this drama. Chief Na Hong-Soo (Yoo Seung-Mok) is a really really really annoying character. Acting like he\\'s mr. almighty Wahhhhhhhhh? Omo... Lee jung shin?? I really loves first season and really excitement by first few series of season 2. Was pleasantly surprised by ukrainian language of Son Eun-seo. Thank you for beautiful drama. With love from Ukraine. Love season 1 love season 2.. Uwaaahh... this drama is amazing. I like voice 1 and voice 2. Jang Hyuk and Jin Wook are both great actors don\\'t tell me he\\'s basically trying to catch himself ... sounds somehow interesting, yet on the other hand ... hmmmmmm3 am i the only one who want a lil bit romance for Kang Kwon Joo and Do Kang Woo? lmao, if there is nothing happening between them istg i\\'ll cry lol. we know Kwon Joo cares about Kang Woo and so does he. i\\'m not asking for a lot romantic scene (bcs it\\'s not that kind of drama lol) just a lil bit, and simple:\\') i want Kwon Joo at least smile and be happy and be normal and stop thinking about psycho things for a while lol Lee Jin Wook....?????????? okay ... why didn\\'t i saw yeesung in this season? i like his character in season as the hacker of the Golden Time Team. okay, why didn\\'t i see yeesung as being casted again in this season 2? i like him last season as the hacker of the Golden Time Team .. The Player will start at Sept. 29 so this drama only 14 episodes? Man!!! I am so happy with LJW’s performance so far. I was afraid after the disastrous Return and he has to fill JH’s humungous shoes from season 1. But LJW is doing a fine job in season 2; just wish he would show off some beautiful martial art skills like JH. Well, JH is something else and yes we are missing him like crazy. I love season one and season two....both comparing two actor I cannot make since I only know is JANG HYUK....hope after this season 2 they make a season 3 so that\\'ms.kang ,Mr.do and Mr.mo will join forces together to make the golden time much stronger....everytime I watch season two can\\'t help to miss defective mo jin hyuk the CRAZY dog.... the last scene of ep 6 0f season2 and preview are much awaited.... Great TV series!!! Very excited to watch the upcoming episodes. Will love to see romance plot between director Kang and detective Do Kang Woo..:) OMG I\\'m so curious after watching episode 6 and now i have to wait a week ugh. But seriously episode 6 was awesome, that horror type case. I\\'m wondering what\\'s behind it and whether Jin Wook had an episode so that\\'s why can\\'t remember how his partner died. Am I the only one who thinks Mo Tae-Goo is a lot more psycho that Bang Je-Soo haha plus he has a lot of connections way back on season 1 but let\\'s see, still loving it Happy to see LJW in his element here.He is one of the best (if not the best ) actors who can portray a detective /cop or any action based role well. Jin wook is good but for this season 2 i hope he can match jang hyuk’s act & character. I have always admired jang hyuk’s act in many of his dramas especially in beautiful mind. This is one guy who can give his exceptionally all & best in any dramas & yet be able to maintain his own significant & unique mark or identity. If anything is wrong with his drama...to me it has to be with a mediocre plot or some sub par writing (eg. Wok of love). Orelse jang hyuk never fails to deliver. However i like jin wook too. jin wook is not just a mere actor. Again and again this guy is reliable & can always deliver his best when taking any drama roles. I have watched the first season with jang hyuk & kim jae wook- that was truly awesome. So fighting jin wook....so far in ep 1...jin wook is great! Anyway all the best...am looking forward to watching this... again fighting! I don\\'t know who\\'s crazier, Moo Jin Hyuk or Do Kang Woo. I like how JinHyuk always says \"I\\'m known as the crazy dog\" in season 1, so I hope KangWoo can match up to his craziness in the 2nd season, I can\\'t wait! The 1st season is way too better then the 2nd. I loved the new man lead character. But the story is not that Wow. you know what? I like the fact that we get a new male lead. It keeps the dynamic and plot interesting. ooo my heart feels weak when Jin Hyuk send email that he will comeback when dong woo is healthier and what if Jin Hyuk and Dae Sik make a cameo in the last episode For me the first series has a great plot and storyline, and for this second series, the plot and the characters in this story are also more that make us grow up and enjoy seeing them in action. So, for me both of these series are very good. Can not wait to watch the next episode. Haha! Everyone knows it\\'s Kwon Yool so they put up his name already Lee Jin Uk is fantastic! Such a versatile actor. Woah, just seen cut scene of actor kwon yool talking with his mom(?) I really love his acting♡ Lee Jinwook is a good choice for the main lead...i know he has BIG SHOES to fill.....BUT after episode 3 i think he can really pull off the character till the end.. I actually recognized the masked man from his nose before getting to know him from here:\"D I LOVE IT and i hope this season would be great as season 1. Now i know who the man behind mask from here, i mean the cast, not the caracter yet Lee Jin Wook is an amazing actor! Love his character so far! The only real cop in the show, since everyone else wanna be so dumb. Stop hating on the show, there\\'s only 2 eps & it\\'s already good! I don\\'t like how the storyline is going so far, I didn\\'t enjoy the first episode. I had to force myself to keep watching it until the end. I feel Lee Jin Wook didn\\'t do a good job with his role. I would have watched it even though I wished so badly that Jang Hyuk would be back. But, after watching episode 1, I don\\'t want to watch it anymore. There are many better kdramas going on which is worth watching. Isn\\'t too early to reveal the man behind mask?:/ or maybe there\\'ll be a twist? Hmm @nameis I think it\\'s Kwon Yool too, that\\'s why I came here to check the cast. lol lools like many viewers think the same I swear i keep hearing lee sun gyun’s voice(pasta,my ajhussi) just watched ep1 and the main culprit is kwon yool.. his jaw-lip-voice are remarkable lol Woahh so this is not only me who think that kwon yool is the killer? @voice lovee I also have the same thoughts as you. the smile is the same as Kwon Yool. Wah i get goosebumps if this is true. We\\'ll se the next episode. I like the male lead , he is the actor with deep expression . he is so rooted to his character. this drama is gonna be great. It\\'s kwon yool.... Suspect is kwon yool.... Episode 1 was a huge pile of crap. I thought this drama will be very interesting. I love how episode 1 tells us about the mainframe of this drama. Thus, Jin Wook is a good actor, I love him in Return. And he is very suitable for detective roles. Yumi: Yes, you can. But I strongly recommend you should watch the season 1 first to understand the character first. Especially, Kang Kwon Joo characterize. Thus, the storyline for season 1 is so interesting and amazing. So its not just me that thinks the killer is actor kwon yool Where is Jang Hyuk? What a disppointment that he\\'s not in this drama! Because in the first series the 2 main leads had something special going on. Who else thinks the killer is actor Kwon Yool? watched ep 1 and it didn\\'t live up to my expectations. it doesn\\'t have the same intensity as season 1; didn\\'t keep me on edge. i\\'m still watching the next episodes tho. let\\'s see if it will be more interesting. It would have been nice to see Yesung return, but I know Super Junior is super busy with promoting:( Honestly, his character was so charming and he connected well with Eun Seo. Maybe a cameo?!? Fingers crossed! Hi guys, I want to ask something. I didn\\'t watch Voice 1 as I was scared. So can I watch season 2 without watching season 1? man in the mask sounds like lee sung kyun. Watched ep 1, disappointed! All the best for this new crime drama! Oooo Kang center coming again Voice 2 is my first priority of all! Goodness! This drama is coming to town y\\'all! the trailers are all thrilling . I am waiting for this! Still cant forget the feel while watch the 1st season Okay so from the teaser, it looks liek this is going to be just as epic as the first one. A whole new story. Even though the main cast isn\\'t completely the same, I\\'ll still give it a chance because it still looks like it will be a good story. With that said, I really hope... please... please... PLEASE... give us an update on Daeshik! They just left him in the hospital in a coma, if they act like that never happened I\\'ll feel so betrayed lol Heard many good things about Voice season 1 but never got around to seeing it nice teasers! have been waiting since the day 1 it was announced! can\\'t wait!! Tbh, i\\'m not a fan of her (female lead) acting. Pwrsonally, Sometimes I find I\\'m bothered by her acting, her breath in this series (I\\'ve watch season 1). to Sunshine. I greatly applaud actors that could take a heavy theme like this as their project. It\\'s not easy to play characters that have to deal with psycopaths and gruesome crime. Even yesung said he always had nightmare after filming the first season. For those asking for jaewook to appear in this season, have you not watch the first season? They clearly said jaewook\\'s character died. I love his character the most in first season but please stop asking for dead character to come back to live geezzzz No Yesung??? I\\'m excited about this drama i mean i was waiting for it after s1 finished but about the main cast i\\'m not shour about it i never seen lee jin wook dramas but ihope that one of the old main cast i don\\'t know jang hyuk or kim jae wook will be present in this season 2 OMG that will be amazing We need to know what happened to Dae-Sik . Did he survive or not. Its ok there is no jang hyuk. Bcs replace by lee ji wook. And maybe jang hyuk case already done. But, not yesung, i just hope there is kim jae wook there. Hahaha Personally I am thriller kind of a girl and I am biased to anything where JH is in. So I loved, loved, loved “Voice 1.” With LJW in Voice 2, I am very skeptical. His last project “Return” was such a MESS in every possible aspect that I dropped it after 8 episodes. I am still infuriated that he chose such a retarded project after “Goodbye Mr. Black” which was so well produced. Well, let See if LJW can redeem himself in Voice 2.......!!!!!!! quite sad that yesung isnt in s2, but still looking forward!! What about jang hyuk?:\\'(( no one can replace his role come on!! I still want the old cast its better with the old cast, i hope jang hyuk can appear again.. Tunnel was waaaayyyy better! I hope OCN can make Tunnel 2 also. Voice was brutal. Guys watch Voice 1 if you havent it was iconic do i have to watch season 1 to watch season 2??? if so, where can i watch it Seriously???? I couldn\\'t even make it past 1 and now there\\'s a 2? With Jin Wook!!!!! I personally find him to be a good actor and handsome but JW, I don\\'t think your agent likes you very much, your most recent dramas have been chaotic messes n now they give you voice!!!!!! Geez. You should have stayed miles away from any script that JH turned down. Yeah a Jang Hyuk cameo will be good!! wahhhhh jang hyuk has already turned down this drama. it was in the news, that\\'s why the male lead is different now. still hoping a jang hyuk cameo tho. Yieeee I really am hoping for Jang Hyuk and Yesung in this drama. This drama is really awesome. thank god there will be season 2 Where is Jang Hyuk?????? waw....so excited...for waiting this epic drama....i hope this drama epic too like 1st season hope yesung was cast again ,,,, No Yesung:( Lee Hana and Son Eunseo are confirmed to reprise their roles from Season 1 of Voice! I hope we get to see more of the mentorship between Kwonjoo and Eunsoo. So excited for this! Where is jang Hyuk?? Finallllyyyyy❤~!! Why Lee hana? Well the title is \"voice\" and the only one who can hear voices is her I wait this for so long. But I thought it would be with the same casts. Jang Hyuk really fit his role at the first one. I anticipated it a lot! The first voice was so good! I am so happy there is a season two. YASH!!! I\\'m waiting waiting waiting waiting for thisss >_/////< I hope son eun soo and yesung will be join this drama again ❤️ Psychopath Kang Kwon Joo is back!! I\\'m curious will season 2 going to have a fight between Lunatics. I still can remember clearly when she said people born as psychopath not all of them are criminals afterwards then she gave creepy smile holyyyyyyyyy shiiiiiiiii Wow.. Voice 2 yeay! why the two not playing together? jang hyuk n jin wook. i think it will be great. 2 hot actors play this drama together. @kiwi I think you can just watch season 2, it looks like season 1 will not significantly affect the new season storyline Do I need to watch The voice 1 in order to understand? Is it good the 1st one? Why lee ha na again omg why Lee jin wook!! Code zero~ code zero~ Kang Center is coming back!!! Please please make the writing better this time... Don\\'t dumb down the cops (I wouldn\\'t have taken it twice were I Jang Hyuk to be honest and am super surprised Lee Jin Wook, esp.after Return, is doing this role. I would expect them to grab the likes of Oh Ji Ho perhaps (though he has moved on from detective roles, he is great at them)... Surprised they snagged LJW but since I watch about all he does, I really hope the script isn\\'t a bag full of plot holes with sand pouring out smothering us with tragic illogical behaviors like going alone with no one informed to meet someone who you already suspect may be your culprit... They did manage to make the most terrifying unusual custom molded weapon in those freaky kettle bells. I still cannot go by a Cross fit with kettle bells visible and not shudder... Now just make the staff smart enough to not make this 20 hours of losing almost all bad guys until someone is on the brink of death! I want Janghyuk ahjusshi! Hoping for Eun-So unnie to accept her role again. She somehow had a chemistry with my Yesung Oppa on the season 1. And I had a strong guts that my Oppa will be in this season as well. I will be the happiest fangirl if my little wish for them to star again in this season will be granted??? Yesung said in a fansign that he will be in a drama on summer. Summer in Korea is between July-August. And between July-August is the second half of the year. Are you thinking what I\\'m thinking, guys?? JANGHYUK AHJUSSI JUSEYOOOOOO ~~ T.T stil hope janghyuk ahjussi will be the lead role for this series:(( Yes.. I will watch it.. Yuhuuu.. i love voice drama.. now i am feeling excited because there is lee jin wook. I hope yesung SUJU also join this drama.. And.. kim jae wook.. i miss kim jae wook ahahahhaa Lee Jin Wook , yesss!!! janghyuk jussi juseyo~~ TT.TT Cool!!!!! But i want Jang Hyuk to be the lead please, coz it suits him Jang Hyuk is the best lead role for this series.I\\'m a bit upset since Jang Hyuk won\\'t be on it he is the perfect lead role for this drama.But who knows?maybe he\\'s not willing to do...or maybe cuz of his other schedule......still m waiting for Jang Hyuk Oppa?saranghaeyo oppaa... =)♡♡♡ I often lose interest for season 2 of a series that I like if most characters will have different actors/actresses. Will try this, but I\\'m still waiting for Jang Hyuk\\'s next series. Voice Season 2 with Lee Jin Wook? Yesss!!! I really think lee jinwook oppa is best actor for this role.. since we know that jang hyuk won\\'t be in this drama ,,, so jinwook is the best i really want him to accept this drama✌ it\\'s my favourite drama ever i have seen?? I\\'m no longer excited about this since Jang Hyuk won\\'t be on it:( I personally think he was behind the success of the first season. lee jin wook is perfect for this role! lee jin wook for the lead role plzz ,,, he is way too perfect . oppa plz accept it you can do it ....... no matter what i will be watching this drama just be the main actor or just accept this drama ,,, return is going to the end u still can do it oppa > < please plz plz lee jin wook oppa accept the role don\\'r decline it ..... i am watching return now and it is too perfect love your acting,, evreything I just want jang hyuk and the other actors also, please don\\'t change the actors, I want them the same as the first season... Sorry if i out of topic but srsly, OCN. Make up your goddamn mind bruh. You ignoring Vampire Prosecutor, almost 6 years and still no news about it? How about TEN? God\\'s Quiz? Sorry i just really pissed off abou it, i don\\'t care about this show anyway..... So excited for this upcoming drama with Lee Jin Wook as the male lead! ok so far the two main girls are on board just waiting for yesung and jang hyuk!! Hope Yesung can be main character main character pls Jang Hyuk, Lee Ha-Na , Yesung and Son Eun-Seo pls... supersnazzy Oh Yea. Why are we sharing the same thought. Lee ha na Jo bo ah and jang hyuk!! For the lead!!!!! Pls We want Sulli to be lead role here Okay since Kim Jae Wook will not be joining the second season of voice, i hope they could casted Lee Min Ki as the villain. I believe he can potrayed the character really well. As for Jang Hyuk, i cant think which actor that could best to replace him. Victoria White SAME!! It\\'s a great drama but the season 1 become more great because Yesung was in it. I really hope they cast Yesung again. I swear to god if they don\\'t i would drop the series. I\\'m only watching this because of yesung, sure it\\'s a good drama but the main reason I\\'m watching this is because i want to see yesung\\'s acting I really have this feeling that Yesung will be joining the cast again. He just posted a photo of him with Park Eun- Seo and Shim Dae-Shik in insta!!! Ugh! Can\\'t wait. Pls announce the cast soon. Who among here had watched Weekly Idol Episode 328?? Hyeong Don asked Yesung if what he\\'s been working now and he answered \"I was working in a drama.\" Why do I have this feeling that this was the one he was referring to?? Yesss ~♡ same cast again please ~♡ Please tell us the casting, ,, can\\'t wait for it it would be so powerful Wowww_ im ded ,.please let janghyukbe the main actor again his actings so amazing ,,,please the same casting & we really appreciate your hardwarking( staff, actor , &singers too ) i really enjoyed voice &niw it will be season2 im ready for it Is this for real?

       "  'comments': 'i ship lee sujong & oh eul soon more wtf djsjjdjs I love this drama.... Beautifully done.. I almost not watch this because i saw negative comments about this but because Park Si Hoo is one of my fave actors i gave it a shot.. And definitely didn\\'t disappoint me.. I love it... Never a dull moment!!! Oh it give me chills in scary scenes.. And i laughed a lot and at the same time fell in love with the two main leads... Oh i think it might have season 2 for sung joong story?! Where he could find his happiness.. Oh i wish ot would have.. A guy with the purest intention deserves such happiness indeed... Hoping that another drama wi be made for him.. Overall.. Highly recommended drama... Just finish watching this drama. This drama has a lot of twist, good horror scene but disappointing romance and comedy element. To be honest, I dont feel any chemistry between the lead. This drama should be called Just Horribly. Terrible script, acting, and no chemistry between the 2 leads. The director must be a pd from Music Bank because the camera keeps moving everywhere like they must be high or drunk. I love Song Ji Hyo in rom coms usually, but it\\'s like she sold her soul to work with this questionable man, like she thought it was worth working with him if he brought in big hit ratings like his previous drama, but it turned out the opposite since it bombed like all of Ji Hyo\\'s past dramas she\\'s starred in have, she\\'s never had a real big hit as the main female lead. What a mess of a drama. Well..refreshing yes...story was ok...but i think 32 eps are too much...how it twisted in the end make the first idea of the story become nothing and emty...it could get better...and the kissing scen did not seem natural at all i don\\'t see their chemistry...i finished the whole eps just to see how it end but i got nothing...sorry... a good drama and nice story. Partk si hoo fix most things and make this drama worth your time! as usual jihyo\\'s acting skill not growing as time past. luckily you have good male actor to make your drama worthed eonni.:) Just finished binge watching this to the end and was pleasantly surprised that I actually enjoyed the series so yep that was drama time well spent. If the Korean audiences didn’t rate the drama I know a lot of international fans did. Well done cast and crew on a great job! So impressed with my bias Choi Yeo Jin one day she’ll score a lead drama role....one day. I really enjoyed this drama. It had a number of moving pieces, which helped keep it interesting. I would like to see a sequel that focused on Lee Sung-Joong, his character is really kind of mysterious even at the end. This drama is so unique, when I laughed so hard then suddenly ghost appear and then they\\'re kissed. What a lovely yet horribly drama with nice ending♥ I\\'m so sad this drama is end.I want to see jihyo sis and phillip.Please more drama with there.I want to see her a police character & royal chatacter. love you lovely horribly teams. Park Shi Hoo and Song Ji Hyo please get married in real life? This drama is so good!!!! I wonder why it\\'s been getting low ratings.:( IMO, the cast has great chemistry. I\\'m even having a hard time choosing between Philip and Sung Joong for Eul Soon. SJH has great chemistry with both PSH and LGK.:) I like how it takes me from one emotion to another, it really is romance and horror mixed together. The actors were also very good, very convincing in their roles! SJH\\'s acting has been amazing the whole time. Love this drama . Never a dull moment . Keeps one glued to the screen with all the secrets and plot twists . The final last few episodes is when the truth gets revealed . Kind of sad the drama is ending soon. Gonna miss Philip Yu! I missed a few episodes and now watching 27-28...am lost. I somehow feel Rayeon is not dead? Or maybe I missed too much and am really lost in this tricky plot. Why is Kim Ok Hee mom to Philip and Eul Soon? I should watch back for a better understanding. This is unlike most drama series where you can skip episodes. I agree with Tipsii. The drama is good until 14/15. After that it takes a nose dive. Because I don\\'t find the romance between the mains believable and there was no build to it. The drama is really cliche as with most drama. The cold rich jerk falls for the poor girl who goes above and beyond for him. This drama is brilliant.I kinda sad because it gonna ended soon.only 4episode more.i love all the actors and the latest episode make me cry so much.I hope everyone have a happy ending especially psh,sjh & lgk All actors ,actreess , and the story line is really really amazing!! Unpredictable. Seems all the actors or actress has secret behind this.. i cant wait for next week!!???? I watched because of Song Ji-Hyo I\\'m her big fan.. Sometimes if the drama make sense , people tend not to watch it. There\\'s so much korean drama that can teach us lessons to live by in reality. This kdrama is brilliant. It has all the elements of a mystery suspense thriller and a nice dose of humour and horror to go with it. Pieces of the jigsaw puzzle are starting to come together and the truth on what happened 8 years ago is starting to come undone ... Ep 23-24 , 25-26 are a must watch. Even though the ghost RaYun freaks me out but can\\'t wait to watch the next episode. LoL! Big applause to the writer of this drama. I wonder how her mind works how could she write something so complicated and twisted and too much stuff going on! She must be a genius. This drama just blows my mind i havent watched a drama like this in a long time. I feel so sorry that not many are watching its sooo underrated. This story has lots of twists and turns and the screen play is good, keeping us watching. Individually everyone has one a good job, the comedy is subtle in the beginning but good. What I miss is the chemistry between the lead actors - Philip and EulSoon. Even their kissing is spark free.. It had a really good start up until 14-15 episode the story and balance was alright but then again writers decided to bring the leads close and that\\'s where they failed to build a bridge... and started to lose ratings... no wonder SJH is a top actress but her chemistry and build up with second lead was way better than with PSH ... you also have to give credit to LGK he overshadowed his counterpart with his brilliant acting and younger looks.. but main culprit behind this dip in ratings is still writer/Director who failed to present the main protagonist in a better way and their build up between the leads was flawed ... I wonder who was the writer who did such horrendous job. Love watching this drama.. The storyline is really good but the chemistry between the main cast is not just sizzling to me. Some questions that arose during the early episodes are slowly being answered. Eul soon had the powers of Phillip\\'s mother when she was possessed, that was why she could see what was going to happen. I actually liked how they answered the question of how she knows that way we will know the other ghost doesn\\'t have the power to do that. I also like how the writer is paying attention to little details and the strings are connecting nicely. It just remains the mystery from 8 years ago to be answered, my bet is that yoon ah was the one with the taser. It would also explain why she was there too and not just the excuse of being there to save Phillip. Very intriguing and unusual drama! Male and woman leads are shown excellently by PSH and SJH. Viewers used to see male lead as a brave handsome guy who fights with bad guys. In this drama Park Shi Hoo showed that male lead is afraid of many things and runs away as soon as he faces a danger. I like the drama a lot. I wanna continue watching this drama but her hair covering the half of her face is so freaking annoying I get stressed out when I watch it OMG.. I love this drama so much..... But ratings are too low... anyway.. Story is really amazingg........ I really like this drama. I really love this film!!! The rating very low because this film airing at the same time with Still 17... Actually this film Worth to watch mystery, romance, horror??? I do not understand why the ratings very low!!!!! Im watching ep 4-5 at the moment and i cant read the words written on Miss Oh\\'s arm.. what is it about actually? I love the song at the end of several episodes. But I can’t find out the name or the artist from web searches. Can someone tell me? It has “Cloud 9” and “mystical lights” in the lyrics. Thanks. Jana wow i loving the show... i think it was the shaman mother\\'s spirit dancing inside of Eul Soon\\'s house..creepy but wow! I am getting more and more excited about the story:) I love that it\\'s funny, unpredictable and very engaging. It also doesn\\'t hurt that the two leads, Song Ji Hyo and Park Si Hoo, have awesome on-screen chemistry. A must-watch! Episode 14 ending so great love how he so chivalry give back the necklace back. But i must said he is lucky i\\'m wonder what happened if she takes the lottery. and in that 3 weeks she maybe really try avoid to get lucky. It is a nice drama but Ji Hyo\\'s hair on her face irritates me. Love this drama! this drama really funny, I didnt scary but so so funny^^ Sihoo and JiHyo really chemistry.. this is unexpected:) fighting Lovely Horribly team I watched this just to kill time but then suddenly ended up staying up all night to catch up the episodes haha.. i love PSH and Kikwang but have a bit -ve bias to SJH since she\\'s been doing to much RM. But this writer character suits her wacky style and of course PSH always excel shining in any drama that needs it:p I can\\'t wait to know why Eul Soon calls Phillip\\'s mom \"omuni\" too.. and what did Phillip do when he said he did so much to stay alive.. since he did not look too good when his mother left him. I thot he should always be lucky when he had that bracelet all the time.. hmm.. got me so intrigued. i\\'ve watched Song Ji Hyo\\'s drama or Movie but i never finished them because somehow i feel bored with her act. But since people said that She has a good Chemistry with Si Hoo, i decided to watch this without zero expectation.. But gurl, i was wrong, This drama is uite good and i enjoy Si Hoo and Ji Hyo chemistry a lot in this drama. I really like this drama.. People need to give this a try. I can\\'t wait till the next episode! Actors are awesome. I don\\'t know why but I don\\'t want this drama to end soon, aaaargh! Very love chemistry about share of fate with si hoo and ji hyo <3 Love this drama so much... Love this. Love park shi hoo and song ji hyo This drama is good, why is the low ratings, Aggghhhhhh im in love with this drama..the plot twist got me like \"wtf\" in a good way EVERYTIME?? and i really love gikwang\\'s character..a modern, fashionable good looking young person who can see ghost? Oh yes please! And i love how his character is always there trynna protect oh eulsoon and witnessing every unexplanable circumstances with her like, at least he is there to trust her? im reaaaaallllyyyyy in love with this drama..and eunjung\\'s character..i really cant made up my mind on whether she\\'s a protagonist or an antagonist but im having fun trying to figure this one out..and who tf is the guy trying to kill yu philip everytime? Love love love .... it’s getting interesting from one ep to another ... It is so hard to wait every week for new ep. good job LH team ... love everything about this drama. Getting me thrill but lol in the same ep good job good job good job? Oh my the ending of 5th episode gave me chills. This drama\\'s getting better with each episode. I hope the ratings increase too. If you drop this drama just because first few episodes you might regret it.. its really start get interesting after few episode and so much plot twist!!! I watch l a lot of Kdrama, and I try to watch all shows that has Park Si Hoo in them, it is fun to see him in a different drama. He is one of the reasons I started watching this show. So far I like this drama. Am really quick at understanding plots and probably knowing how a drama would end from the beginning but I swr I must confess this drama has confused me lol in a good way thou coz I can\\'t seem to guess or predict any single thing that\\'s gonna happen? The drama is making me so eager by the minute I just can\\'t wait to know what\\'s goons happen I wish it was a full movie instead of a drama but what I can say now is good job It\\'s a good drama but I can\\'t watch it alone. Thumbs up for the writer of this drama. SJH got the role she deserved. Fighting! Anyone knows the song title at the end of episode 1—4? This drama keeps on getting more and more interesting as the story progresses and the back story slowly unravels. I think I\\'m going to stick with this until the end. I\\'m curious as to how the story will progress and the explanation behind all their misfortunes. This is so far a great show! Acting, writing, everything. Highly recommend. Can\\'t wait to watch that next episodes.this drama is amazing..funny, scary and romantic too.I like SJH and PSH character.. they have a good chemistry. Love it....?.good luck I wasn\\'t interested in the drama at first, but when I saw Ji Seunghyun, I surrender. I must watch the drama to support him. After portraying a North Korean soldier and a thug (in Wolgyesu Taylor), now he\\'s a murderer? I wish he could portray a good man in the future and perhaps becoming a main lead. Please don\\'t waste that handsome face and great talent, dear producers and directors. i haven\\'t watch it yet but reading the sypnosis their is a similarity with the movie \"just my luck\" that they need to fall in love with each other to avoid the curse I think Philip\\'s mom feel guilty to Eul Soon and her family because she change their destiny, thus making them go through misfortune. So, she open dumpling place near Eul Soon\\'s house dan make her like her daughter because her mother passed away. About fire that happened eight years ago to Philip, i think his mother know he is in danger because she used fortune teller so she had the ability to see the future and asked Eul Soon to help him. But I\\'m still confused what happened to Ra Yun and woman with white dress who always following Philip and why that masked man wanted to kill Philip. But very interesting drama, make me curious and want to watch it over and over again. I miss this genre so so much. The last few ones were Master\\'s sun, let\\'s fight ghost! and oh my ghostess. and so far this plot is unique and keeps you on your toes. Please have more of such plots rather than the boring typical rom-coms. I was a bit worried about this drama at first since I wasn\\'t a big fan of in the beginning but I\\'m so happy I stuck with it. I\\'m completely hooked now! The mystery that seems to tie all of the characters together gets interesting every week. Eul Soon (Song Ji hyo\\'s character) is such a refreshing character to see, her positivity brings tears to my eyes sometimes. Hopefully it\\'ll continue to do well and get the ratings it deserves. Now, this is something, something. Thumbs up for writernim, for every past stories revealed. Great cast n crew, PSH n SJH have a good chemistry. Actually, I didn\\'t really like spooky-horror drama, but this one is making me insane. Somehow, it\\'s remind me to beauty and the beast story, like you should find your \\'loved one\\' to broke the spell. Haha, it\\'s going to be great~ Wow this drama is awesome love it,goonna watch it till the end...??this one is really interesting I love this drama!! So many funny and scary scenes. it has all the elements!! I can already sense the love triangle between the main actors/actress!! I can\\'t wait to watch how the story unfolds!!! Lovely horribly fighting!!! i\\'ve seen horror/thriller/supernatural genres in kdrama but this is one scary drama! i thought it will just be as funny and scary as Masters Sun but no, this is really scary and gory i\\'d say. keep it up! this drama is amazing and interesting especially my favorite actress no other than song jihyo who act incredibly on every episode. though some cast members are good too but I amaze how our song jihyo act here. love her and support her aaaaaaalways.?? Love u song ji hyo!!!!!!!!!!! Drama is awesome!!! It\\'s a good and funny drama... A must watch.. Song Jihyo Eonnie, FIGHTING!!!:) <3 The drama is sooo good and funny.. A Must Watch..:) Song Ji Hyo Eonnie, Fighting!!!:) <3 I thought I\\'d be scared to watch this drama. I\\'m not a horror film/series buff, but, I took this one into an exemption because of Hahm Eunjung! hehe... And I\\'m glad I did! Tho I seldom see her after 4 episodes, somehow, the main lead did justice for their portraying their characters. But, definitely waiting for Hahm\\'s cause I read that there\\'s a twist on her character or something?! That I have to see! Watch this ... Lovely Horribly, it\\'s a scary fun to watch! You wont regret it! This horror drama is more funny than scary ! The storyline is intriguing. Can\\'t wait to watch the next episode .? Wow!!!! The script is just amazing i\\'m waiting for the next episode hoping that it would last a lot more longer and i was so amazed by the script made by Eul soon I really love this tv?show. Can\\'t wait for next episode. I didn\\'t expect anything after I watched the trailer. But I started anticipating for the next episodes after I watched the first and second episodes. waaaah i love the story and also ji hyo can\\'t wait for next week .... Really like this drama, can\\'t wait for next episode, song ji hyo really great, love it.. I really like this drama, can\\'t wait for next episode. Song ji hyo totally get it. Love it..? I really love this drama! All the best and high ratings in Korea! Fighting! Fightin unnie?? finally good drama on KBS. im suffering of \"post-traumatic syndrome\" from Are You Human but then this drama came in...yes u are rite, this drama is out-of-kdrama rule book...but i love it...LOL when philip yu asking eulsun why she name the character rayeon, then she said its bcoz she is eating ramyeon...i was cracking hard..hahah.gonna keep watching Jihyo & Eunjung, horror queens! Ok, I did not expect to like the drama but guess what? I\\'m in looove with it.. now I have to wait a week to know if the writer really died or what!!? I love this type of drama! The crime is similar to The Moon Embracing the Sun, misuse of chant/spiritual power. The combination of horror and humor works here. I hope next upcoming episode will be great and even greater. \"Lovely Horribly\" is too silly and too irrational for people over 30. And too scary for people under 10. But if you\\'re between 10 and 30 years old, you might definitely like it. Some people below me have drawn parallels with American movies, and indeed, the mix of humour and horror in this drama looks typically American, despite the obvious Korean setting. Anyway, I will let you decide if all this is good for you. This is pretty EPIC!! I love story, very catchy and entertaing. The pilot episode really got me hook, this actually turns me on\\' truly Daebakk!! Looking forward for more, just love the cast really their all good! Definitely a must see!! FIGHTING <3 ALRIGHT I GOTTA TELL YA\\'LL THAT JI HYO IS HONESTLY A RIOT IN THIS ROLE. I have to wait for the next week. so interesting 4 episodes and love this drama already. Yassss for Ace Mong??? this is like the movie killer toon! Loved the movie so much and loving this drama even more! I loved the first ep so much that an hour felt so short! SJH has shown so much range in the first two episodes that I\\'m really amazed! Korean version of \\'Just my love\\'. The first episode is legit, you will love it ^^ the comedy is well delivered through a various type of character, the mystery and suspense is good that able to make you wanting the next episodes to come faster XD and the plot is interesting! the cinematography also nice ^^ See Ha Dong Hoon?? i just love the cast of the drama Wow!! Mon-Tue drama\\'s are intense!!! Thirty but 17, Life and now lovely horribly. My weeks are fully loaded. Cant wait^_^ OMG!! Can\\'t wait <3 Looking forward to see it!!

       "  'comments': 'Lee YuRi is amazing in the drama. Idk why i really hate Ha Yoon-ju a.k.a Suah. Her bf doesn\\'t even care about her.lol After taking my time for one month for actually finish watching this drama, i come to the conclusion of this drama being the kind of story that would give you a bittersweet feeling. Speaking on my experience, the first quarter of this drama was not as engaging as i thought i would be. I didn\\'t know what actually took me out which had me having to procrastinate this drama this much but it worn me out. As the second quarter of the drama kicked of with the revelations happening and all, things started to get more interesting and that was when the drama finally intrugued me and finally made me taking my time not because of how this drama was making me fatigue but because i wanted to take my time to appreciate it and it got much better in the last 5 episodes. Min Chae Rin\\'s character might give people mixed receptions but i could understand her and the decisions and actions she took even though they could be really wrong. If someone were to deal with such life she led for 20 damn years, they\\'d probably would act the same. I believe Ha Yeon Joo\\'s character aka Min Soo Ah later on lacked consistencies and i believe a lot of people could see that. I don\\'t believe a transformation of personalities she had was natural in fact she didn\\'t even know the exact reason for you know what but chose to get carried away with what was happening. I believe the writer fucked her character up to add spice to the plot but i see it as a not so great approach for it would only made it hard for people to root for her when she realized her wrongs. The ending episode was i believe could be added better closure for it since it\\'s not even a full hour long but it was still a nice ending, something i didn\\'t initially thought i would get but it was actually more beautiful than my expectation of it. Anyway it was a good watch and i thoroughly enjoyed the acting especially Lee Yoo Ri and Jung Hye Sun harameonnie lol, directing not so much but not actually terrible or anything, and OST was pretty \"classic-esque\" but for some reason fit the moods. I just loved this drama... I regret that i didnt watch it earlier... lee yu ri unni i love u even more after watching this drama❤❤❤ I love this drama so so much , I haven’t seen the season 5 is it out? Anyone pls? I love this drama! I miss it so much... The soundtrack sounds amazing too! I hope I can see more projects from the actors in the show. Lee Yu Ri you are the best The ending tied up everything nicely. watching this because there’s Lee Yuri!! finished watching 2 episodes & give this drama a try! hope it’s a drama worth watching n_n Writer, you have a very, very sick mind. I don\\'t know how were you capable to create in one script so many evil characters? Not even one single character is worth to be an example to follow. I\\'m not surprised that are so few comments on this drama. If LYR (who by the way is not capable to play another type of character) had not played in this drama, this would be a total fiasco. BIG spoiler just go away if you didnt watch; the thing about this drama is that you would rather like how it started or how it will be ending there\\'s like double personalities for the two female leads the first female started like a crazy woman who would do anything to keep what she got after 20 years of struggle she was crazy about her office acting and after 16 episodes she became a flawless person. The second female lead started like verry simple and upright woman struggling with the hardness of life to keep her family. She was unconditional for her husband-to-be she had a lot of occasions where she proved that she\\'s a forgiving person, she had pride she was happy while being poor and belived money isn\\'t a way to buy a people she seemed inteligent and tried hard to be loved. but after the first part of the plot was revealed, she became a selfish person out of the blue who thinks that money could buy anything destroying the heart of people without blining a eye. thers\\'s no way you could like the female lead in the first half and no way you could like the second lead on the second half. the plot is intersting but the development of the caracters personalities is ZERO. and that\\'s the problem with the korean drama\\'s nowadays they could mess with the personalities anytime when it\\'s benefic for the plot\\'s take up. i really like this drama, i keep guessing about what will happen in the next episode. I don\\'t usually comment but this drama is really really good. Some of you said that you could not understand the plot, yes indeed I agree, but this is what makes it more attractive for me and I don\\'t get to know what will happen next which is the case of several other dramas. I am enjoying this drama. I hope the grandmother will have consequences to her horrible behavior. She is so selfish and vicious. I like the lead actors. I don’t normally comment until after I watch the drama and believe it was awesome. However, this drama so far, despite some loopholes, is awesome. The characters have so much depth and I wish the full background stories were revealed faster - but hey we have about 30 eps to go. It’s not your typical lovey-dovey cliche drama where there are set definitions of who is bad and good. It’s realistic, a bit too exaggerated at times. I love the leads! There is controversy about their relationship, however it’s bittersweet like dark chocolate hehe... I hope CEH endures with his affection for MCR and isn’t swayed when HYJ is revealed to be the lost daughter. I hope MCR doesn’t do anything silly ahaha and that MJS finds true happiness with somebody who he truly cares about (HYJ sisters???). HYJ will probs end up with the dude who is searching for her and CEH will be a free man please (with MCR)? - his eyebags are eating bigger each episode. As for the granny - I guess I can understand her paranoia about bloodlines but I hope she has a spiritual awakening. Also, who is Ms. Kim - could she be... MCR mother? Anyways, ratings are increasing rapidly; worth the watch! HyunSook Yeon Joo\\'s fake mother is annoying me. I can\\'t believe how she can face Yeon Joo with that baby talk/ fake smile acting all sweet when she kidnapped her to save her own daughter\\'s life. I can\\'t wait until the Truth is Revealed. Why all lee yu ri shows is the same like Jang Bo ri, twinkle twinkle? She is the substitute and don’t get her foster parents love This is another Korean drama where it\\'s difficult for me to understand what the plot is. After watching the 1st episodes, what is this program about? Can someone please explain the plot? I don\\'t want to watch 10 episodes before I can finally begin to understand what is going on. Thanks. I\\'m here for Uhm hyun kyung There was a time i was hooked up to my computer to watch my favourite serie. And yey me this time came back. I hope that SA will not turn into a negative character, because in that case, this drama will be full only with negative characters starting with CR, or maybe not. First place is occupied by grandma and second place is gained by CR. CR doesn\\'t have the necessary power yet to become eviler than she already is. Ppl say this drama is not good, but how come the ratings keep on going up week after week ♥️♥️♥️ For once, Im so tired of people branding Soo A as the heroine and Lee yuri as the second fiddle or antagonist. No, Lee yuri does not play second lead... She is shown as realistic as possible... If tortured and in that terrible situation, I would be banging my head that character comes out as angel. Only Lee yuri can bring these type of emotion in me, where she can be quite ruthless yet fragile. Obviously ha yeon joo is SoAh from the firrrst Episode?? Good story, different from others. Very creative writers. Good actress and actors. Satisfaction I don’t know why but I hate Ha Yeon-Joo! I love this drama ♥♥♥♥♥ Im watching this bcoz oc lee yori, i like her since yellow boots and jang bori. Thr best of the best actress ever. She know how to do heavy character, well she always do heavy drama right?. And that granma too very convincing, she is the ruthless and devilish of all character in this drama. I think that yori will play antagonistic and protagonistic character, you\\'ll see after watching first 4 episodes, its clearly through that events, yori will become evil and gets revenge on everyone who whas made her suffer. And i like song chan ui too, i feel that he already has a great chemistry with yuri in this drama. I think we will more pity with the villain character, i mean min chae rin will turn to the darkside later episode. Lee yu ri never fails to give me goosebumps...The reason I watch this drama is mainly because of her!I love her so much!After watching 4 episodes of this,I feel so sorry for Chae Rin.She doesn’t deserve to be treated like that...The cruel grandma and So Ha’s biological mother are awful and selfish.I wish Eun Hyuk make Chae Rin feel to be loved...They look good together!I don’t like Eun Hyuk with Soo Ha! uniieeeee one of the best actress. fighting and more drama to come I watching this drama because of Lee Yu-Ri and the cast of drama is so good. Lee YuRi always amazes me. Her acting is so good. She really takes those slaps like a champ. I couldn\\'t do it. lol I love this drama so much, The Grandmother has no Mercy. Ruthless woman. I love this dramaaa twisted but awesomeee cant wait for saturdays? Lee yur i is not a villain or whatever everyone is saying she is. Rather, her character and the other girl are both victims of this luck-twisting ceremony the grandmother wanted. If anything, chaerin is victim to all the unluckness of the other girl since their lives are swapped. It’s jusr that chaerin wants to prove that she can survive regardless of the suffering she has to go through! It\\'s makjang, but it\\'s actually better than I expected it to be. I was amazed by Lee Yoo Ri watching the 4 episodes! She\\'s truly unbelievable... I love her so much!! She\\'s drop dead gorgeous!! And her acting is unrivaled, she kills everything with her layered and her precise acting. I got chills when she was locked up because of her acting! And her chemistry with the male lead is really intense when nothing happened between them yet <3 I can\\'t believe I\\'m saying this but: I can\\'t wait to see what happens next, please don\\'t disappoint me ㅠㅠ I feel like the slap that the grandma did to Lee Yoo Ri will be so painful? I feel like \"Hide and Seek\" tries too hard to be melodramatic: there\\'s always women shouting, kids crying, ominous music pumping, even when nothing happens in the story. The director really needs to learn to tone down. When they dragged Lee Yu-Ri under the rain, at the end of the 1st episode, I found myself laughing, because the scene was so excessive, even though it wasn\\'t supposed to be comic. Frankly, Lee Yu-Ri is the only redeaming quality of this drama, but I would prefer to watch her in a romantic comedy rather than this role. Can\\'t wait!!!!!! Love Lee yuri but could not get past first episode. Usually wait for a few episodes to watch or not but this one does not seem to be worth the time. Lee Yuri could act as heroin that has crooked,cute,badass,kind,sweet,villain,psycho like personality at the same time. This is a drama that I\\'ve been craving on, a drama that has villain as a heroin. I\\'m tired with princess gone bad kinda drama, now let me watch some bad b*tch become a nice person. Yuhuuu.. I don\\'t like Lee Yu-Ri. She always plays dictatorial characters, but I like Song Chang-Eui so, I\\'m giving a try to this drama. Lee Yoo Ri is drop dead gorgeous as always:)).... But...This drama seems like a big makjang bullsh*t tbh... I already feels the headache thinking about it, but gotta support my bae and watch it for her, at least I know I won\\'t be disappointed with her amazing acting skills <3 Is Lee yuri playing a villain or a heroine?? I love Lee Yu Ri.Her acting is sincere,strong,funny and deep when necessary I feel sorry that she deserves so much yet gets so little from Kshowbiz I hope Hide and Seek will be success. I so glad because I can see Lee Yu Ri. Looking forward to it because of Lee Yu-Ri:) Lee Yoo Ri drama is a must watch ♥️♥️♥️ Looking forward to this because of Lee Yuri unnie ❤ i miss her acting!',\n",

       "  'comments': 'Seriously another Daebak drama that deserves more hype if you have watched Master in the Sun & Bring it on Ghost I highly recommend this to you. This comment my contain Spoilers: The cast was amazing but am more intrigue with Gil Chae-Won past (shes my favorite character) I wish they could have explain why she lost her spiritual power after touching the Priest body? There are a lot flaws in this story specially with Lee Da-Il being stuck in this world, honestly if Sun Woo-Hye said to him \"that make sure if someone will exist like me help them also\" I would have understand if it went like that. Also where & what happen to the little girl that they help? Also who is the unidentified body was being move in morgue? Am really confuse in that scene in ep2. why would they focus that scene when it was not Lee Da-ll\\'s body cause the psychotic Nurse said he was the one who stole his body. Daniel Choi is really hot in this series!!! All this while he got nerd like character that put the glasses on... But in Ghost Detective were different...!! At first I didn\\'t realize it him until I read the cast.. He Really Awesome and Hot even as ghost >.<\" hahaha.. I\\'m looking forward his new work without glasses like this... Well!! This is the most unique & most beautiful horror series I\\'ve ever seen with a bittersweet love inside! ❤❤ And Da Il & Yeo Wool will be my favorite couple forever!! ❤❤ Acting, Camera angles, Lightning, background music & VFX were all excellent as a horror series.!!.. @SHQA it\\'s kinda interesting that you were confused with the plot.. i think it was not confusing even with the flashbacks and all but that\\'s just me..i can\\'t speak for everyone else ^-^.. the flashbacks made me undrrstand the story even more...and they can actually see him at some point in the drama and at the end because he learned to show himself by will/emotion.. same thing with being able to touch things.. he learned it from the ghost by the tunnel... I started this drama mission for Daniel Choi, and endured the 32 30-minute episodes for Daniel Choi. He is the most charismatic, photogenic, handsome K-actor. His acting skills were well-utilized in this drama. I was not going to watch it after reading all the negative comments, but honestly, it was good drama. Marathoned it!!! Don\\'t get stopped by the negative comments, give it a try! You might not be disappointed after all. Season 2 Please! Did Da Il really died or what? And please add kiss scenes for the next season T^T Season 2!!!!!!! When? Hope season 2 again! I love you! T_T Only 1 and 16 episode is super for me.The rest of it....boring and creepy.. Love the actors and their (the team) chemistry. Geezz, I just watched this drama nonstop and finished it in a day! Thanks God its finished when I watched this, the story went really well keep you watcing them nonstop and guessing what will happen, whats their plan and all. Really! Hurry make the season 2, even though it’s little bit creepy, but I love the main role in this movie and still want to watch them. No progress on their relationship?? Come on, it’ll be perfect with romantic kissing scene XD LOL I loved the show!! Yes the ending could of been better but I\\'m hoping since it was pretty much left open, that a season two will be coming. There could be amazing stories created!! What other evil ghosts there could be. Lee ji-ah made my hairs stand on my arms. And lol, yes, when he is driving, remember he said he can make people see him. Plus where was the emotional kissing scene when they reunited? (Sigh) season 2 please. I really like this drama because of the two main lead, but there\\'s no kiss scene for Eunbin Ghost Detective started with a very strong plot and a list of good actors which was why i chose to watch it but towards the end i couldnt keep up with all the last minute theories thrown to us.. the ending seems rushed.. we even laughed on how a dead Da Il drives the car (stop with the car promotion already) LOL the ending was really funny and wasted Yeo Wool\\'s precious tears Awesome!!! Except kinda shitty ending - they could have either given it a episode more to sort it out or a episode less to end it with timing and great ending. SPOILER!!! I can\\'t believe it, until the end, Da Il and Yeo Wool didn\\'t have kissing scene. Done watching... . great beginning, slow in the middle and perfect ending. This type of drama you have to do marathon, can’t watch for only 2 episodes each week , because will lose momentum of the story line, got little confused and less excited ... I don’t mind watching season 2 with different case each episode , just like the Voice or Criminal Mind type of drama..... I love crime drama . KBS need to learn little better to make crime drama more like OCN . I will miss the cast. T—T ... the story plot was not well made. it wasted the good acting of the actors. its not convincing and realistic that a 12 year old child can think that kind of crimes committed. so dissappointed with this series. Great drama with great actors... Too bad it has to an end. Thanks for your hard work, we had so much fun watching the gost detective. Season 2 please... This is definitely one of my favorite dramas this year! ♥ I know that is not perfect, but their chemistry....♥ Love them!!! It\\'s 32 eps right? Why it\\'s just ended like that and even too short I love the main leads it\\'s too bad they were paired in a horrible drama. I wish it was a romcom or something more bright and logical. Eun-Bin is so cute and talented and Daniel Choi has a great charisma but unfortunately this drama is a trash. the best thing in it is Joy and Mark\\'s ost watch this for lee ji ah & heo jung eun.. Initially I was really into the drama because it was scary and interesting. Moving into the next few episodes it started to get dull because the story kept being told around Sun Woo-Hye character and all the horrible she did and still does. But OMG from episode 27 onwards its such a bore already. Everything is so damn repetitive. Lee ji ah and kim won hae have a very great acting skill. Tbh i love sun woo hye\\'s outfit they\\'r so cute (except the red one lol that so scary). I also love how mamamoo\\'s song played here?? What a catastrophic and ridicilous mess this show is?! Yes, I agree that the storyline in last few episodes wasn\\'t very interesting, but I still somehow love this drama very much. Choi Daniel and Park Eun Bin have one of the best chemistry I have ever seen in drama land. Just love Da Il and Yeo Wool ♥ All I can say I am glad I did not drop this drama. I like this drama, it is scary when you watch it late at night. I like the team and their relationships. The leads scenes are so cute and sweet in so many ways, it doesn\\'t have to be kiss scene, you can feel the love and caring. The cop guy is so cute, i have not seen him b4, I like him. Love the autopsy lady, she is so damn chill and cool. They dragged the red dress lady too long and it was like an endless progression. Sometimes I feel they promoted the cars instead of the drama. The drama is okay, only how the character played their role, like the detective, you know that Woo Hye can control human mind, why do you have to chase her alone? You can\\'t even use the gun your holding. Now, you even tell her where her mom hide Da il\\'s body, so frustrating. I started watching Ghost Detective a few days ago, and finished the first eight episodes. The constant flashbacking filler makes REAL TIME feel like it is dragging the plot. I feel bad for 3 main leads, Daniel, Eun Bin and Kim won Hae, they deserve much better story line. They have been on high profile dramas and their acting top notch. This plot kills the mood. I am watching because I like the two main leads. But the drama seriously need major twist besides the 12 yrs old ghost. Or maybe add romance? If this turn into short movie maybe better, but not 16 episodes drama. I like this drama but actress Lee JiAh as Sun WooHye is ruining the drama for me. Her acting is horrible. I never want to criticize any actor but I can\\'t help feeling this way about her. Annoyed! I really enjoy the drama. It\\'s one of the best I have ever watched. I can\\'t quite understand why people hate it so much. The plot needs time to develop, so don\\'t expect to get the answers right in the beginning of the series. It\\'s a mystery drama! The female ghost has the mentally age of a 12 years old child. Therefore she acts so childish! I admit that the beginning was quite boring, however few episodes later the story starts to get extremely interesting. I love the love. The plot is boring. Stop! @Sori_023 at first I was annoyed by her too, but in ep 3 or 4 we find out she is a 12 year old kid who got into a coma. So that\\'s why she acts like that. She acts like that on purpose because she\\'s portraying a 12 year old. The story is dragging - I\\'ve watched up to 22 episodes so far and there is not a single improvement in the woman-in-red\\'s story line. Why the heck she is able to control every mind whether she is alive in flesh or just a revengeful ghost; main leads\\' story is not interesting at all and the fact that they keep meeting the woman-in-red everywhere and then nothing happens is the main theme of this drama. I plan to stop watching until all the episodes are aired and then watch the final episode to see how the story ended just out of curiosity:) I agree with Jaycee, the story is not going anywhere. 12 episodes actually is enough for this drama. I still watch it only for the cop, LOL. Skip, skip and skip I only watch his part. It\\'s really getting too bored..I\\'m giving up this drama no improvement in 5 eps it\\'s really disgusting!! and their is no logic! sometimes they say his alive they got to know it after 9 eps still 6 eps to go but it\\'s waste watching! actors are good but it\\'s for nothing ..i\\'m so sick of this drama series started off well..but title should have been the lady in red ghost! drama is already halfway through and it\\'s still on the stupid lady in red..and the story is not going anywhere. complete letdown. ..i had thought storyline will revolve around his exploits and talents as a ghost to catch his culprits..but he\\'s running around in circles over 1 stupid bitchy ghost. not watching anymore. I’m up to latest episode, still lost but hooked to this drama .not sure why but really want to know the motive of her killings. The ost so good remind me of Goblin . Rating is low in Korea but sure gain attention in Viki. This type of adult drama is rare and we — international viewers love it . And did I mention Daniel Choi so handsome , I mean his transformation from Jugglers to this drama almost unrecognizable. Park Eun Bin is cute, Kim ajhusi always versatile . Now it’s still halfway and we just need a good story line ...good luck to all cast. i love all about this drama... I like this drama a lot but the evil character Sun WooHye is terrible. The character is evil but she tries to act cute (vocal tone) while she should to be vicious. It\\'s so annoying. It makes her character less believable. Her younger self is more evil & vindictive and menacing. I think they could have picked a better actress to play WooHye. She needs acting classes. I hate to say rude things about actors but she is totally ruining the drama for me. I have high hope on this drama for first couple episodes but it’s getting little slow . I hope more story behind it and not all about woman in red on killing spree .... Great cast , pls PD nim don’t waste their talent. Daniel Choi looks good , I hope he still alive. This is poorly written especially when u have 2 other ghost drama to compare. I love watching it from the beginning because of the cast, it\\'s comedy & da-il sherlock thinking but no more. What\\'s ruin it is the ghost woman concept & the romance. A witty and well-crafted love letter to old-school horror tropes. Good drama... I have watch until 13-14 ep.. cant wait for the next. the drama is so ridiculous and poorly written. I originally love the leads but I feel that they don\\'t know how to deal with this bad script. it\\'s a total mess. I\\'m just watching for the scenes that Joy\\'s ost is played in. I hope they release the ost soon I like all the cast but this woman in red storyline is so boring. After 6 episodes I find myself thinking who cares? I hope the writer changes the story so it’s a ghost of the week detective show, that would be infinitely better than this dry storyline where a woman kills people in her coma for no real good reason. The actresses white face and red lipstick is also getting on my nerves. The role is so bland and cliche she doesn’t have the charisma to make the character more compelling. Fingers crossed she dies next week so the cast can get to work on some real ghost cases. Am i the only obe who ship yeo wool and the police officer?? why yeo wool didn\\'t search lee da-il body first? ah she doesn\\'t care about him Great chemistry even if Da il and yeo wool doesnt have romance on screen you can still feel the emotions going through with the characters or perhaps its the artist true emotions with each other!!! shipping these two already! My favorite thriller kdrama. Still 12 episodes but it feels like last ep. I ship Da-Il and Yeo-Wool and I hope Da-Il still alive:\\' Ship Dail and yeol oh no, lee da-il chose to become an evil spirit to save Yeo-wool, why did she do that without thinking it through, she should know that crazy guy is trying to get the women in red to possess her from watching the video, why go there by herself. look like the women in red will regain consciousness, and lee da-il will have to pay a price for meddling with the living since he tried to kill her. already watch ep 9-10 and I think the person who had nursing the coma woman that happen to be women in red ghost is the one who bad guy. he use her to kill everybody.maybe he got his own history.can\\'t wait for the next ep.. I ship Yeo-wool and Da-Il ❤️ I dont know why but i ship yeo wool n that police officer. They look cute together? Watching this drama make me remember for GOBLIN.. the soundtrack also got similar. ghost and human love romance? i LOVE this kdrama!:D is it weird that i’m shipping yeo-wool x woo-hye ( Woman in red ) <3 unidentified body is not the woman in red, episode 6 show that she actually is in a coma and hospitalized, they made the ruckus before he was kill, after that he went to the daycare and got killed there, I think in case of unidentified body is because he got no criminal record and nobody reported him missing, thats why his body is unidentified, I think in Korea people don\\'t normally getting their fingerprinted unless it\\'s for criminal record or for immigration, or they could check his dental record assuming he\\'s going to the dentist regularly, otherwise the dentist don\\'t keep their patients record for too long, they get rid of all the old records after a few years. the case that he can touch her or she can touch him is still unclear, and another interesting character just pop out, the doctor with glasses Gil Chae-Won she seem to have some special power too, she can touch something and can see its past. its only 6 episodes and there are so many questions, its interesting though, will wait for more. i still can\\'t accept Lee Da iL dead.. Crazy dog is back! Ajhussi!!! The unidentified body could be anyone. It could be the woman in red. Choi Daniel fans here? Choi daniel fans here ❤ Choi daniel fans here❤ If he is truly dead then basically the title itself is perfect... self explanatory...but there are scenarios that scriptwriter must explain.. 1.) how was the girl able to flip him as whichever angle you look at it you can’t touch a ghost right?! I come here for kim won hae ahjussi I don’t think , he’s in a coma because there was an unidentified body in Ep 2 Remember the scene where a covered body with a tag was being pushed and then Daniel appeared in the shadows...that must be his shell. Gausah ngegas: no. They are different person:) How could they just let him die so fast. So the main girl was just going around talking to air? how did she feel the touch on her shoulder anyway Maybe he is in the hospital in coma and his spirit is just going around till he wakes up. I seriously hope so. For the teaser i knw this is horror movie. And i think that i feeling scary watch horror movie but as i see park eun bin is female lead so okay i will watch this drama. And yeah this is very interesting horror drama , choi daniel is very perfect being detective. From the ep 1-2 i want this drama give romantic scene however just a little wkwkwkw and wow male lead actor is dead when i\\'m watching ep 3-4, i feel a bit curious who is the girl wear red dress? Can\\'t wait for the next episode The red dress woman is the ghost from death woman from why secretary kim?? Deduction skill,love this<3<3<3 remind me of sherlock holmes:D so he\\'s dead, and now becomes a ghost detective, ah I kinda had this feeling that he\\'s dead from the end of last episode when he had this surprise look on his face at the end of the episode, so he probably looked at his dead body, and the unidentified body in today episode is his. This took me by surprise, didn\\'t think the writer would let the main character die from the beginning and become a ghost, still interesting so far, will continue watching. the biggest question in this show, who is the lady in red? Judging by the first two episodes this series is looking to be awesome. Daniel Choi is real good as a detective and Kim Won-hae is always a perfect actor for a comic relief sidekick. it will be the best drama I just watched the first episode. This will be a good one!! The cast are good too. Ep 1 really good...creepily interesting..wahhhh...i dont expect this drama turn out to be the best!!!! Definitely worth to watch..they pick the perfect character for choi daniel as the lead..they really did... Choi Daniel ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ Aah glad he is doing amazing and different roles. Im so much excited because i get to see him more and more in positive male lead roles. And i might asking for more but i want to see good bonding relationship in this drama between Daniel and Eun Bin ❤ I think i\\'ll watch this drama bcs the previous drama of this writer was good (wanted). I dont mind with the cast too so iam in. Good luck. im so excited. i love both and trailer is so good. =) im so excited. i love both and trailer is so good. =) Teaser made me sh*t my pants! So scary@! Daniel\\'s actually coming back!!! Daniel Choi? I still cant get used to see Choi Daniel without glasses. It\\'s great to hear that this is park eun bin new drama but it also sad thing for me because this is mean that there is no AOY season 3 this year TT Looking forward to it. Two more months... So funny because Park Eun Bin acted as Lee Ji Ah\\'s sister (young counterpart) in \"The Legend\" yuhuuu both of choi daniel and park eunbin are my favorite....:) I like u, you\\'re handsome but you should stop wearing those glasses.it makes u look old whereas your not Yay!! Loving the cast and Hope Park Eun Bin accepts the role? Jang nara please Okay liking this maybe ryu hwa young for female lead',\n",

       "  'comments': \"It ended at 100 ep:( I still want the 20 ep left lol. This drama is different than normal one. it is irritating at first but it slowly and gradually they improve and the plot start becoming stuck with you and will absolutely love it. the ending is kind of rushed.. I wish they would continue it a bit more and make it for realistic ending. Its a happy ending but something feels missing. Kim Bok-Man is really irritating to the max. Hope Jin-Ok divorce him soonest! just started this drama it feels a little different more comedy than drama but thats ok its very funny the story line looks promising and interesting so im gonna stick with this drama it bothers me that the lead couple dont match at all at first i thought he was her father he just look much older for his age and the 3 amigas are hilarious but what happened to the 4th amiga oh well we will see finally, Ahn Sun-Young has a leading role. well, one of the three. I always feel sorry for women or men who get stuck in supporting roles or 2nd leading verry good drama light and easy to follow so far i'm pretty satisfied with the acting happy it's not another historical drama\",\n",

       "  'comments': 'I was missing Choi Jin-Hyuk after watching the last empress, so I came to watch this drama. I definitely got my Choi Jin Hyuk fix LOL!!! I enjoyed it 100%!!! I hope everyone watches it!! ~~~ Bad videography ~~~ The last scene (bloopers) I really taken aback it was really funny & cute specially when Gong Jin-Yan aka Queen Mother appeared LOL. Also Hoya was Daebak at first his acting was really annoying but as the episode goes by he really develop his character well. Am I the only one who notice how much Oh Yeon-Seo & Lee Joo-Yeon resemble to each other even their voice sound the same. I almost made a mistake its Oh Yeon-Seo Super cute romance with a happy ending but this whole Doctor patient relationship as it progressed was just too wrong!!..on so many levels. This one was truly a perfect thumbs down for me....there is nothing worthwhile to watch in this drama...right from the very predictable storyline to the very mediocre acting performances by the otherwise talented actors....this one is a typical kdrama where the holier than god main lead forgives and literally forgets everything and the murderous aunt and her gang of evildoers go completely unpunished....I mean how does a doc who commits such heinous crime doesn’t even lose his license to practice medicine? In the end, the main lead’s goodness overwhelms the doc and he backs him up....also,our hero who suffers from dementia remembers his ladylove as soon as they meet and hastily takes her in his firm embrace....omg, this drama is filled with all kinds of absurdities....will definitely not recommend this one? I really love Gong Ma sung!! Choi jin hyuk did a lot of crime/ action dramas, but I really like his characters here. He succesfully expressed the emotion of lead character. As someone who felt really sad about his memories but want to treasure it a lot. Wow the actors of Tunnel meet again in this drama! This drama is definitely worth watching. First of all the story line is NOT cliché at all. It\\'s very different than most memory loss movies/dramas. The plot is actually so interesting and it all fits together. Also unlike a lot of dramas the evil characers parts don\\'t drag on forever. For example the heirs - (Choi Jinhyuk was also in the drama but played as the leads half brother) and in the heirs like a lot of dramas after the leads love each other they would drag the family problems, family inheritance stuff (usually when the family doesn\\'t want the relationship between the leads in the drama) But I must say in this drama they don\\'t have long unnecessary scenes for the evil characers and everything makes sense. I\\'m not gonna add any spoilers just in case but if you\\'re planning on watching it prepare yourself because it\\'s awesome. I swear it\\'s soo good. Good enough to keep me up until 6am to watch it and wake up at 9am and for it to be the first thing I remember. It\\'s also shot nicely and they really payed attention to the setting and stuff. The leads also have soo much chemistry. Their behind the scenes moments are so cute and they seem very comfortable with each other. This drama deserves a lot of views and they must win a lot of awards at the end of award shows. Cliche plot and terrible acting. CJH is better of in crime dramas and what happened to SHY in here, she was much better in Fight My Way. All she does is pretend to act cute here and I could barely feel any emotions from her. 0% chemistry from these two. love this kdrama its awesome and worth wacthing it Just realized the original drama title is based on the leads names: Maseong\\'s Kibbeum. Makes total sense and it is worth watching. I watch this drama because of Choi Jin Hyuk but end up liking the second lead, second lead have better story line and chemistry. Unlike the first lead who fell in love in 5 second and the female lead is not suitable for Choi Jin Hyuk, she looks like a little kid and not attractive at all. Idk why she was casted, Suzy will be more suitable for this role. I skip all parts only to watch Ha Im & Ki Joon. They are so cute together The best romantic korean drama I\\'ve ever watched. I love Choi Jin Hyuk, his acting is great as always. but this drama itself is such a disappointment. Lack in too many ways and sorry to say but seems like a low budget drama. did not enjoy it had to stop after 4 ep. if the guy has to humilate his future girlfriend and the girl accepts all those things and get together you have to be a real dumbass they could defenetly worded on a better script Loveeee loveee this drama, must watch drama.i have watched them for the second time in row???...love their acting..they were sooo natural... I love them!!...thank you for all your hard work...its awsome!...beautifull script and plot?....I love u Go Ma Sung shi...the sexiest guy everrrr???...love your acting..i\\'vebeen watched almost all your drama...and they were amazing??...looking forward for next drama...sarang hae Choi Jin hyuk??? I had a GREAT time watching this drama from episode 1 to 16 (\",) Like someone else said, the first 14 episodes were highly enjoyable. The last two were somewhat sluggish, but worth it. The end was cute. Gi-bbeum and Ma-sung perfect pair. They look so natural and their kisses are endless not that I\\'m complaining instead I love it. I\\'m done watching this drama but I think I will watch it again. Both leads are super great. It was such a nice atory indeed and selection of actors and actressrs fit to their character. I must say that this is one of the best Romance Comedy and Drama that I\\'ve ever watch. Hope that they will work again and prayong that they will be in real. I always thought Choi Jin Hyuk is a good actor but his acting skill has gone to a whole new level. Although it\\'s a rom-drama and he had done many of this genre, somehow I felt that he really nailed it as Gong Ma-seong. He\\'s really quite exceptional in this role. In fact, all the rest of the cast are really great too. So far, no one was cringe-worthy. Thoroughly enjoyed it! BRAVO??? I really love this drama. The chemistry between the main leads is strong. For the first time after a while I kinda think they look good together, their eye smiles are similar. Previously I had this feeling when I saw Ahn Jae Hyun and Goo Hye Sun in Blood. But I don\\'t really care or wish they end up together or not. Because drama is drama. I love this drama till now hoping for the happy ending ...... Please don\\'t end with any sad angle .. Hope in the last everything gose well...... My only hope is a happy ending but seems like it\\'s far fetched? Episode 14? What did you just do? I love this drama.looking forward for happy ending.i really like the male lead. His good in good in acting The lead casts were so perfect...luvyah both..Keep it up?????? Wish for happy ending for both pairs. I know filming was completely finished before any episodes aired but looking forward for a happy ending. I love it.???? Oh my, does the male villain (KimBum Soo) in this show have an endless supply of gum he can pop? The gum popping is ruining an otherwise decent show. Aargh. Such frustration Great drama, I didn\\'t find any boring part of the previous episodes. Happy ending....really in love with this drma Something is wrong with the ratings!!! This is a beautiful drama, beautiful acting! Como\\'n people! I swear this only had 12 episodes... Very nice story. i hope this drama would have happy ending? Nothing new presents in this drama but Jin hyuk n ha yoon, made this drama enjoyable..love both of them.. I reallylike Choi jin hyuk an d I liked Song Hayoon in Fight my way. BUT I this drama was not my cup of tea. Too cringy and bit unrealistic as to how the romance progressed. I am sure many love this kind of genre. I am just saying if you are okay with major 2nd hand ebarrassments, then this is your go to drama. Every scene with hoya is so hilarious!!!!! I love this kdrama so much!!!! Looking forward to upcoming episodes!!! OMG!! Best drama since Boy over flowers and Heirs. I love every single episode and can\\'t wait for the next ones. She is just too cute and he is every year that passes even more hadsome. I give it a 5 star raiting as being excellent tv show. Love it, love it, love it!!???❤ wwooww..i loved this drama... main leads are so so cute and their chemistry is wonderful.... i think the hight difference made them look soo attractive togethar.... and his smile!! ... ♥.. looking forward... good luck. Love them so much!!♡♡ I wonder why they are not famous at earlier time. They are both so cute, the film has made my day! Wish they are couple in real life! Superb drama. There a lot of chemistry between main lead! Even supporting actor and actrees did a good job. Superb drama. There a lot of chemistry between main lead! Even supporting actor and actrees did a good job. Super recomended romcom. This is the best drama from CJH, he has best chemistry with SHY. Love this drama so soo much...... Much Love from NEPAL?? love this drama.. I cant wait to see the beautiful ending.. pkease dont make it into sad ending because its hurting my heart... I love the chemistry between the main lead actors however I am feeling pity to the girl when they kissed the girl suffer alot and seems not enjoyingbthe kissing sceen because she is too short.. GO Ma Sung help the girl by putting your body bit down and reach her lips so the kissing seen while standing will be much adorable..??? The chemistry between the lead actors was superb This drama is funny, sad, romantic, suspenseful, heartwarming. I love ti se Choi Jin Hyuk again. Cast is awesome! OST are beautiful. Wow,watching this makes me feel like I\\'m dreaming. Like Choi Jin-Hyuk in most drama. This one is ok! The female lead’s physique does not match CJH. She is just too short! She looks like a kid when standing next to him! Just can’t take them seriously, sorry! Hate the vicious aunt, dr. Joon and Kim bum woo! Just want to slap them every time I see their face! Hope for good ending where all the vicious people get their punishment! There chemistry is really Match, both are cute even though the girl not tall but she pretty. I love this drama. This is the cutest kdrama of Choi Jin-hyuk..he smile so Naturally..and I love their chemistry...fighting for the People behind this drama... I love it. i love it. cant wait for the next episode:) love you guys My favorite drama at the moment! The worst drama of Choi jin Hyuk,, stop at ep 5,,, This drama is really refreshing and underrated. The main lead height makes it soo cute. ❤️❤️❤️ WoW.Just WoW and Awesome. I really, really,really love the drama so far, I love you guys. Keep it up. I hope the ending will be great cos we are looking forward to that. Why ratings so bad? Im so sad.

I loved ....so much Devilish Joy... I love this dramaa??? Oh my!! The eye candy is so very pleasing. I could look at & listen to the main lead all day long. And ladies, that man knows how to kiss. Great drama. I\\'m enjoying it very much.?? Omg.... I loved choi jin-hyuk Love it!! Hooked from the 1st episode. The 2 main actors are great, they have such chemistry togheter and up to know not an single boring part. The height difference between the two leads is so cute. Nice and simple drama loved it till now. Hooking from begining because of lead\\'s chemistry but seeing GI bum struggle for life make me feel her sadness under her brave look and add depth to it. it\\'s a cute and charming drama that\\'s easy and fun to watch but at the same time feel characters\\'s emotion so vividly . OMG!! It\\'s was really nice stories and also all the cast ❤️❤️❤️ the storyline is very interesting, it\\'s different from the other korean drama I\\'ve watch (romance drama). also, the actor and actress is good in acting . really love watch this drama . hoping the ending will not make our disappointed. looking forward to it. FIGHTING!!! Daebak...? Hooked since the first episode. Looking forward for the episodes every week.One of a great kdrama worth to hit the rating!!! Cheesy in begining...heartbrocken at 1st quater...N now lov in the air through the middle Super like and love the story..it\\'s cute??? one of the best! This drama got me in tears in just 4 eps! predictable storyline but who doesn\\'t like this type of k-drama? really love the chemistry between the two actors <3 (this is the first time i wrote a review online regarding a drama:\\')) it\\'s just that good i hope many people would watch this and give it some love. I love this drama, i\\'m always looking forward for the next ep. This drama makes me laugh, cry and feel love. I totally ship them! Choi Jinhyuk x Son Hayoon. Thy\\'re perfect together!!??? I love this drama.. the lead actor and actress has a great chemistry ❤. Hoping they can be together in real life?. I can\\'t wait for the next episode Love this drama❤️ Love this drama. Love Choi Jin Hyuk. Hoping for a happy ending which is not possible in his drama. One of the best dramas I\\'ve watched so far. Thanks Dramafever! Choi Jin Hyuk seems so comfortable in his role that he actually is the force that draws the viewer into the story. I can seriously say that this drama and many Korean dramas are worth seeing more than American ones. I like the intrigue and that desire to know what the ending will be like - the suspense is killing me! His aunts worry me too. His accident is not resolved either. His neurologist or psychiatrist friend is a big question mark as well. I know there is a conspiracy somewhere but unsure yet. What is the reason for the secrecy of the accident \"3 years ago\"? Why can\\'t he tell her about it? Looking forward to the rest of the series and solving the mysteries behind the story. Great writing, awesome actors and actresses...I\\'ll be looking out for more dramas starring these great people! Mahalo nui loa from Hawaii! I luv this drama so much wooaaah, this drama bring me back to kdramaland after a few months I haven\\'t watch kdrama I started to watch this drama because Hoya? Love this drama...the actor very good in acting and i am realy enjoyed watching this love drama.....waiting for the next episode.... Wrong move for me to start on this drama. I have already contained myself for 2 weeks but lost my self control and binged due to lack of any good dramas now. Wrong move. Love this drama and Cho Jin Chuk did not fail my expectations. Cute couple as well. Just hoping against hope that this will have a happy ending and the cerebral atrophy was just a twist in this story. huhuhu. LOVE LOVE LOVE this drama soooo much . . . Love it much..❤️ Wenesday and Thursday, oh my can’t wait for that long to watch a new episode I really loves this drama.

Waah it\\'s Choi Ae Ra\\'s friend from Fight For My Way, she looks so pretty in that picture. I have only seen Choi Jin Hyuk before in Emergency Couple, his acting was pretty good back then and it\\'s probably even better by now, can\\'t wait to watch this couple specially because the plot seems interesting. @Shycst dramax is the one who created My Secret Romance and Something about 1%.

       "  'comments': 'This is such a GREAT DRAMA!!! Trust me, I\\'m a sageuk maniac. Omg D.O was so damn amazing with his acting, each expression, each gaze, each dialogue. I\\'m not even an exo fan or whatever, I\\'ve noticed him when watching their performances (he just have that eyes) and so I was interested to watch this. was I blown away by his performance? absolutely yes. I would say he is now one of the TOP in my king/crown prince list. Superb performance, he deserves an award for this. How on earth can he be a singer, dancer and act like he had been attending acting school since he was born? Amazing talent you just cant deny it. I can\\'t stop thinking about this drama it must be one of the top! (SPOILER ALERT!!!) Jihyun and Kyungsoo are everything! The chemistry between DKS and NJH off and on cam is overwhelming, i cant help but falling In love. They are really comfortable with each other, and NJH always knows how to make DKS laugh. I\\'m sure I\\'m not the only one falling for this cute pairing. I SHIP SHIP SHIP! Do Kyungsoo and Nam Jihyun\\'s chemistry is so beautiful I really enjoyed watching all their scenes!! I felt like watching a real couple\\'s lovestory. <3 Started become exo-l after watching this drama. Do Kyung-Soo is such a good actor!!! This drama was really sweet. Thumbs up to a great cast. Didnt watch this at first because i dont really like historical drama but my friend keeps asking me to watch this. Finished all the episodes for 3 days and its so good. Love love love Really love Kim Jae Young!! Love the drama for its rom- com. Not love its plot for politic. I love historical drama. This drama dont do justice for history and politic. Even the plot for conspiracy is not convincing. Just light genre drama you can watch without having the feeling nervous of who going to be kill next and who going to take the throne. Recommend if you like rom-com. The actor even extra are excellent. If you like light genre drama. This is for you. I really love this couple. I like when holding hands scene. It\\'s like teenagers couple not marriage couple. Maybe if they have project in the future, they will have story from teenagers. I imagine they will look cute wear uniform and fight like teenager couple. hello guys. in 17 episod (special episod) and between 39:50 to 45:30 a song played. does anyone that song name?? please???? I keep coming back to watch 100 Days My Prince..Guess I miss our Woenduk and Hongshim. Maybe it will take a long time to see them in one drama again and this makes me a bit sad, but like our Woenduk whose heart is full of love, miracles do happen. I shall wait for the day when their love story unfold again. Meanwhile, stay happy Kyungsoo and Jihyun, take care of your hearts, one day true love will really come and when it does, hold it closest to your hearts and don\\'t let it go. Remember you are so loved by many . For the people behind this beautiful drama, much love to you all, we miss you, our Wongshim and the entire cast and team. Thank you once again for bringing 100 Days My Prince to our life...<3 i done watching this. Now i dont know what to do with my life. Will miss this couple. i honestly think that this is a great drama. as someone who aren\\'t a big fan of kdrama, this is the first time that i actually watched all the eps without skipping some parts and succeeded on finishing it in just a week. probably because i\\'m an exo fan and i love do kyungsoo xD but really, I see that he really improve a lot with this drama, and the chemistry with nam ji hyun is no joke. i expected a lot of conflicts and stuff since this is historical drama but i\\'m actually quite suprise by how light-hearted this story is. i do cringe a lot at some parts but oh well this is a romance comedy, historical drama after all. i do have a bone to pick though, and it\\'s about the (kind of) abrupt ending?? at least for me. i legit went like \"that\\'s it??\" when i see ep16. maybe bcs my expectations were high at that time. not really dissapointed but i do think that it could have been done better. but still, i want to give a thumbs up for all the productions and actors, all of them did a great job! it\\'s definitely worth all the hype it gets <3 Good drama. Laugh,love,sad,happy, everythings good, i just diss at the ending i dont know why.. but D.O so good in acting really. I recomm this drama This is a great drama, i will recommend it to watch. The drama is fast paced without any loophole, not only main cast but every supporting actors were also great, so check it out without hesitation if u are a drama lovers... I am pretty sure that people will be reading reviews about this drama before watching. Of course you will be seeing nice and nasty comments when you scroll through. As for my advice, go for it without hesitation cause this drama is totally worth your time. I recommend to watch it as it is personally to me, a very well-made drama. Some may think the ratings are so high because of the main actor as he is a popular singer-turned-actor. Well probably that helps too. But I can guarantee that you will fall for the whole cast of 100 Days My Prince as soon as you watch it. And don\\'t worry about their chemistry, they are overwhelming. You can check the behind the scenes. Please watch it. It is a great drama. 100 Days My Prince is now my favorite Korean drama ever. Beautiful plot and such an endearing cast.. I fell in love with the lead characters at once. Im now a big fan of Do Kyungsoo. He has the most soulful and expressive eyes, innocent and pure. Truly a great talent. Kudos to the Creative Team of 100 Days My Prince, Thank you for bringing to life Won-Deuk and Hoshim in our quiet Monday and Tuesday nights . They are our precious miracles To the Director, Scriptwriter, the whole staff and crew who made all of this possible thank you. I hope that there will be another project for them together. Much love to the cast and tvn. Dear 100 Days My Prince, This drama is amazing!! I just finished it. And it\\'s.. Daebakk!! Love all the characters, plot, stories.. I enjoyed watching this drama tho\\' I was expecting a lot more of action scenes at first in the last 2 episodes. I\\'m still satisfied how it ended. It\\'s a rom-com genre after all so I understand why they chose to focus on having a hilarious scenes instead of being deamatic. can\\'t remember how many times my stomach got hurt from laughing because of this drama. I really love its humor. Idc if others find the storyline cliché. Romcom genre doesnt need a unique plot in order to entertain the audience. Btw, kudos to the staff prod, cast & most especially to Nam Ji Hyun & Do Kyungsoo for giving us a wonderful drama. Hope to see you guys working together again in a new drama. Maybe in a modern drama? How about WonShim couple being reincarted in a Reply series??? i just finished this drama... i dont know why the ratings were so high and i dont feel the chemistry between the main leads. For me, it shows a lack of emotion and dramatic aspect like they’re just delivered their script to each other. Love in the moonlight and Hwarang are better than this. I have mixed feelings about this drama, whilst i loved the chemistry between Won Deuk and Hong shim, I do wish there was more action on the part of the vice premier. It seemed like it was all talk and no action which eventually lead to his demise. The villan part wasnt that entertaining. However the days the prince spent wth Hong shim were funny and nice. it\\'s a copy cat of love in the moonlight... I\\'m so bored cuz they basically just copied most part of it:\\'( I really love this drama...like really really love..still can\\'t move on with woon deuk & hong shim.. need season 2 please..hahaha. just a little disappointed with the ending.. i really hope that the ending scene will show both of them get married in a palace. I would love to see hong shim in a princess outfit.. but nevermind..as long as the ending was happily ever after.. congrats for the all team.. saranghae.. 100 Days My Prince is such an enjoyable drama to watch. Love this show. For y’all haters look at its ratings. 14.4% for the last episode. Korean people don’t agree with u. And so do I . I love this show, my fave of the year. Great Cast, plot, villains and even setting. It’s also very funny I just love it so much. ❤️ I\\'m going to miss this show and our wongshim couple so much!!! I hope it receives many awards!! For me it has taken the spot of my favorite period drama of all time. I love it. But the drama lack of emotion and dramatic aspect. The crisis only happening in the last two episode. Maybe one and a half episode (:v) Thats super short. In dramas that I watched, at least the crisis begin in episode 13 and solved in episode 16. And even the problem solved easily (lost memory, finding it again, beat the evil) (((\\': I thought Hong shin was gonna moveon and left crown prince and someway meet him at the palace or something . Hong shin didn\\'t even try to move one (lol,) she\\'s just straight went to hanyang (to find her brother) but that\\'s like the place where wondeuk lives rite? Their meeting was easy too (: Hong shin lives where she lives before which is super ain\\'t dramatic , I wish wondeuk gonna tried to search for Hong shin cause she lives at different place but nah, that\\'s to complicated aren\\'t it writer-nim?, Lololol thanks BTW for the drama I enjoyed Kyung-Soo soooo much luv for all the cast The plot was not dramatic , yup I love cheesy dramas about childhood lovers, but the crisis in this drama just in the 15 and 16 episode which is super short amount of time (lol/) there\\'s not really much surprising event, even when the crown prince got his memories back was not even dramatic at all (\\'\\'\\'\\'\\': OMG i will miss you guys!!!!!! i need season 2:(((( I really like a happy ending story... Thanks for that... Hehe... Thank you for such a beautiful story. I love love love the pairing of Do Kyung Soo and Nam Ji-Hyun. But I’m a diehard follower for her and Ji Chang Wook! But the plot development, the characterisations are so well done! Do Kung Soo is so adorable when he acts so sweet and when he makes those mischievous smiles! Congratulations for another wonderful and superbly done drama series! There were twists and turns that makes even the most vile characters admirable, for lack of a better word to describe them. I would have wanted for more episodes but the title itself talks of the 100 day the Crown Prince was missing. I will miss them but I’m already binge watching it again!!!! Thank You and Congratulations! i loved this soooooooooooooooooooooooo much ...... the acting was on point and the plot was awesome ... it\\'s so uncomfortable that the drama ended;.; Sad to see the drama end too soon. Great casts! Start to fall in love with Kyungsoo acting from It\\'s okay it\\'s love, he has some real talent in acting. For the main actress acting is a bit flat and lack chemistry with Kyungsoo. Have seen some dramas with her on it all the role she played were just the same character. My two cents. Really expecting more drama with Kyungsoo and Kim Sun Ho on it.:) OHO! *in wondeuk-ie accent xD I rarely watch historical korean drama, this is one of my favorite sageuk drama <3 I am feeling very uncomfortable that this drama is already completed. DO and the rest of the cast did a great job for such unusual short historical drama. Awesome series.....i love them all.....Do Kyung-Soo is very cute and handsome actor....little bit sad bcoz series ended today. the story is fast but not too fast. light but still pretty complicated. funny but has many mistery and action scene. so for me this is perfect. i\\'m really satisfied with everything of this drama. its been a long time i\\'m satisfied with a historical drama. last time i could remember is love in the moonlight and scarlet heart ryeo I like the story of 100 days my prince. I hope there\\'s the season 2 coming. I can\\'t wait for watching the next season do kyung soo\\'s acting is superb I watch korean saeguk drama only, why this drama end too soon??? Is it only me? Or is the crown prince\\'s bodyguard (dong joo) really dead? How I wish Kim Cha Eon and the Queen soon to be punished. Finally my wait is gonna end soon. Do kyung soo is really cute acting as a rude character... i fall when he tells “ ha ha”.......... the characters were modalized completely cool into an ancient set up.... good luck with this drama... arghhhhh I want Moo-Yeon and Kim So-Hye end up together .... This drama is so good... I don’t want it to end...??? 16 Eps long enough for me, the sooner I see the bad guys get what,s due them, the better! 16 episodes is long enough for me, the shorter the wait for the bad guys to get their due the better! I cant wait how this wonderful story ends..i kept on making my own ending in my mind..but in the end my thought always ends up in me and kyungsoo being together...??? just kidding... this drama is so good 16 episodes is not enough! Ep 13 Hong Shim cried. I watched it twice and still I cried like crazy. Ep 14 most awaited kissing scene that was a surprise it was so short though. Jeoha is making me uncomfortable he looks so handsome. I love their chemistry:) .. Great ratings by the way ^^ My heart ached at the final scene of ep 13. It was so dramatic. The two leads really did a great job in their roles? Cant wait to see the next episode I\\'m so proud of this cast!! They\\'ve done such an amazing job and definitely deserve the good ratings they\\'ve been getting the last couple of weeks! I\\'m so sad there\\'s only 2 more episodes to go. WonShim couple hwaiting!! 16 episode is not enough? Ohhoooooo! Losing patience. ...can\\'t wait to de end Did Seja regain his memory while asking about Eunuch Yang???:L Seriously korean dramas need to chill with amnesia plots. It goes on for longer than neccessary. In this case, the new governor doesnt even recognise the crown prince. Its frustrating and delays getting to the point. We only have 16 episodes, they cant avoid to take time gettin to the point I hope can have season 2 Oh no, this is coming to an end.:( i found the first few episodes slow in progress, but now im really excited on how all the truths will unfold. i just realize that this drama has only 4 episodes left, so... Am I the only who feels really bad for the crown princess and moo-yeon he obviously cares about her and I\\'m fairly certain she cares about him too they\\'re the honestly the most tragic love story of this whole series. Not fully but i think he regained his memory and just pretending not for some reason.. I am just wondering how this drama will end.. Hope the two main leads will end up together.. This is getting more exciting and the first historical kdrama that gains my interest so far... Thumbs up! to casts directors and writers... I like this drama, but I don\\'t want sad ending. I like D.O and Nam Ji Hyun. I hope Crown Prince regains his memory. The left state Chancellor & Crown Princess need to pay for their crimes. I can’t stand them feeding him lies. I hope Crown Prince’s Eunuch is still alive. im curious, is the bodyguard dong joo really died? i dont believe it actually since theres no sign of the dead body was him In episode 12, the story line is so hurtful. I feel really bad for both Won Deuk and Hong Shim.:( Congrats to all the casts especially to Nam Ji- Hyun and Do Kyung-Soo for this Drama\\'s two-digit rating. You truly deserved the high rating for this one of a kind drama. Your hard work is evident in each scene and episode of this wonderful drama. I have a bad feeling about that last 5 episodes , Hoping that the ending won\\'t dissapoint me. Love D.O and NJH chemistry ❤ I love this drama so much, all characters are on point. great chemistry. Kyung So and Ji Hyun are perfect. Im curious jung je yoon character..he supposedly cannot remember people by their face..but how come he easily remember hong shim?? I think this drama very good, we can learn how the rich man can life with low status and it make him Happy. The best drama this year so far!!! Hope it wont end into a tragic one like scarlet heart., My full support to kyungsoo and jiyhun., I bet You will get the best couple award this year., fighting!!!! Ohooo!! How dare youu I noticed it just recently that the whole story is in flashback mode. I love this drama. I love everything about it! I love this drama. D.O and NJH has great chemistry and sweet together. Fighthing!!! Ohoook!!!! @ mimi In one of the earlier episodes he says he cannot recognize faces, so he tries to identify people by their voice, hands, clothes, etc. Story getting interesting ... it\\'s picking up. Can\\'t wait till the story unfolds. I just love EXO Do and Ji Hyun are a cute couple, they\\'re good together. I will continue watching till the end. Hope there\\'s more episodes.. 16 is too short:-( 100 Days My Prince this drama is freaking awesome. Full of mystery and unpredictable. Seriously! I\\'m enjoying it so far; I hope rating will continuously be rising. Thanks to all casts and production team. Why Jung-Je Yoon didn\\'t recognize the face of the crown prince? It really puzzled me. I love the story much. Woahhh its almost there ...kyungsoo yahh the 10% rating youve expecting is almost there..fighting!!! The story so cool but great. I love this drama. Romance but comedy. I enjoy watching this. I impatiently waiting for the memory back of cute Crown Prince. They are great in acting. love this much soooo much. i love this drama. i love exo d.o. Wonderful drama.....I don\\'t want an end to this drama.....I wish the episodes should extend... I’m eagerly waiting for his memory back ,,when it will be I found the story has been quite progressing in ep 8, just my personal opinion that i think the writer should be doing it sooner because i imagined different plot. I want lee yool back to the palace soon and fight those evil people one by one, while hongshim being his concubine and still support him. I found the other on going dramas boring. But this kept me glued since episode 1. Do Kyung is a Kpop star and a natural in acting. He always has the role of a mentally unstable person and executes the role quite well. I am crazy over rom com and yes this is romcom as I laughed often while watching. Of course that is beside the dark side story of the palace and all. I love the other supporting casts for the peasants surrounding Won Deok. That is what a community should be. I\\'ll comment more on the story after the ending. I do hope for a happy ending! Tho i know historical dramas have tragic endings. I didn\\'t see it was boring at all, i really really enjoy the show, the progress is make senses. Really love the lovey dowey between won deuk and hong shim. DO.. i\\'m your fans now The plot progress too slow and too boring The story great. But a little slow. To be honest, the plot progress only by the end of the episode so far. I do find this drama still enjoyable despite people keep saying that it was boring. Maybe people keep expecting it to be a heavy drama that full of twist plot. I love this drama. I am glued to the TV when this show is on. Always something new and exciting happening. If you think this is boring....you haven\\'t watched the same show. I just finished #8. FANTASTIC!!!!! I\\'m curious about the reason of hong shim\\'s brothers job as vice premier\\'s assassin. As you know that vice premier is the one who kill his late father. There is another one..i think crown princess is pregnant of hong shim\\'s brothers baby. But i\\'m still vague because hong shim\\'s brother seems like didn\\'t know anything and just say congrats to crown princess.. i don\\'t know that is he just pretending or there\\'s a deal between him and crown princess. OMG iam so corious...! i really love this drama. i havent watched kdrama for so long because the plot is always the same and the drama get boring in the middle but ive watched this drama from 1 to 8 eps (current eps) and i am very satisfy with it. it may not be the one drama that have a really heavy plot, it more toward light, comedy romantic drama. i cant stop smiling when watching and after watching this. Always amazed by DO acting, but worried about the ending, please let DO had happy ending love story, love you both DO and NJH, .. Why do i feel like hong shim\\'s bro will die at the end? Honestly i think the brother is most interesting character.. The writer should do something it is getting boring though I am really disappointed I really love this drama. When everyone knows the crown prince is alive, they will investigate who tried to kill him. And for sure, Hong Shim\\'s brother will be the one they put as the attempted murderer. How sad... I love all both character. I have been waiting this drama from i got new information if Nam Ji Hyun will come back drama. And I really glad because both the lead are my favorite actor and actress. I have became nnam ji hyun fans since she played in queen seondeok , and i have fallin love with d.o when I saw him in exo next door ha ha ha i thought d.o is the charismatic member from exo:) fighting nam ji hyun and d.o I like this historical drama. The characters have portrayed their role well. There is so much to expect especially the conflict in the story and when the prince can remember himself. Nam Ji Hyun is so lively in most of her kdramas Fav drama?? I\\'m watching this drama and I like it, but I find the plot very similar to Shopping king Louie (which by the way I also enjoyed watching). I like this drama and hope the ending is a happy one. @ying mooyeon is hong sim\\'s brother that she was waiting every 15th of the month. You can see in the previous ep, there are some flashback about hong sim\\'s / yi seo past. This is really good so far. Worth watching. what mooyeon and prince seowon relatonship with kim so hye? @Ying @Ying. It is consider a *SPOILER* or not but I\\'m gonna tell you only the main part of the story. It about a Prince who has a bad attiitude because some stories in his past life. Oneday he disappear and accidetally end up married with \"a comman woman\". It is a nice drama, you won\\'t regret it. I just wist this drama won\\'t end up tragically Han So Hee ❤️ Kim Jae Young ❤️❤️❤️ I haven’t started this drama because i’m not really into historical dramas but Nam Jihyun has been one of my favorite actresses and i can’t seem to pass by it, although i’ve passed by some short videos through instagram, i am very curious about Mooyeon and Hong Shim’s story, can somebody share me a brief explanation of what their relation is and what happened in the 6th episode? i would be wonderfully thankful if anybody can explain! thank you so much in advance! Oh love this much, wish that the amnesia of the crown prince will be gone soon. Next episode please, highly recommended. Love love love Love this so much I know D.O acts well but the way he portrays his character in this drama is proving that he is a lot better. Loving this so far. Love njh too! Love this so much. Can\\'t wait for the next episode. The casts are good, Its acting as well as the prince Do Kyung So and Nam Ji yun. All casts act great. Please nxt episode pls. I love this drama so far. The pacing is great, the acting is good. I could see the beginning of a chemistry but it\\'s still not there for me. The comedy had me laughing. I hope it will continue its momentum. I love nam ji hyun. She’s paired with D.O. in this drama and their chemistry is great. Now i like D.O. too. I’ve been following it since day one and can’t wait for the 5th episode. I would recommend it to friends. Can\\'t wait for episode 5!!! The chemistry of wonshim couple is sooooo lit!!! I keep watching this because of kyungsoo and nam jihyun. Their acting is great but the plot is a mess! 4 episodes in, and already a mess. @Kyungsoo kkut I think that Red Camellia cant actually believe that Hong sim was only 24 years old (for Korean age),but since I\\'m in the Philippines were we followed american age, she was only 23 years old and playing 28 years old on this series. At first i refused to watch it because I\\'m not fond watching historical drama, but after watching episode 1 i cant stop my self looking for the next episodes. kudos to writers and directors for this wonderful drama. This drama somehow similar to ruler: master of the mask..but this one is funnier version..a good and warm drama to watch after Still 17 finished next week @Ai won deuk is just an imaginary person that jihyun make herself because of she doesn\\'t want to marry yet. The crown prince make a declare that his people to get married if someone still single. The crown prince has lost his memory that\\'s why jihyun take the chance that crown prince is his won deuk who are just came back from military. furthermore she doesn\\'t want to married that man who has 4 wife that\\'s why she get beaten, and the crown price save her from marry that man. Can anyone tell me why nam jihyun called him Wondeuk? I cant recall he tell her his name when they were a child I dont know why lately i really likes do kyungsoo acting...? Damn it I should’ve waited before watching them episodes!!!?? now I can’t wait for the next episode!!,2@?,@/‘xbxskx Anyone know name of flower on the poster? oh my life! i don\\'t think i can make it till the last episode...my heart . ok im trying so hard to stop myself from watching this or else im gonna die waiting for the next ep HAHHAHAHAHAH but i watched the trailer and its so surprisingly good!! Omgg..i am in love with them. Uri Kyungsooo, love yaahh. So exited to watch the upcoming episode. I cant show how enjoyed i am when i watched you gaess. Feells like i want cry... Love loveee yaahh episode 3 please!!! Wow, can just say, the child actor jung ji-hoon is really good at acting for his age, that it kind of scares me. what a lovely drama. highly recommended:* i so love it...fighting.. It\\'s a cute couple! They look really nice together! waiting ...... pls quick I\\'ve just finished watching the 1st Episode and it\\'s really a WOW. Each scene was beautifully and perfectly executed. just watched episode 1, the ending scene gives me chill. Really loves their atmosphere and chemistry. Keep up the good woork, kyungsoo-shi and nam ji hyun? Just watch the trailer, and I\\'m already impressed by the acting of DO kyungsoo and NJH. Wow! I saw 1 episode and it\\'s awesome! D.O. and Ji Hyun really impressed me. Storyline very interesting and great) I\\'m waiting second episode. I have watched Episode 1 live!! As expected , our DoKyungSoo is really good at acting . He is Multi-talented singer indeed ……??? Omg cant wait!!!!! Please make it faster I cant wait for this drama. I hope it is as best as My Sassy Girl last year. Because i like that kind of plot and romcom. Not too heavy in politic. But cant wait!!!!!! After watching all the teasers it seems that the crown prince had a childhood crush on this lady whom he wanted to marry but due to his position he couldn\\'t hence he faked or circumstances became so that he ended up with the same lady as an adult but only for 100 days I Am fan NJY...and I want see this because The Line Story very interesting and i like NJY AND DO (EXO) acting...fighting... I\\'m looking forward to seeing Do Kyung Soo in this drama. I have loved his acting in all his past roles. I\\'m sure I\\'ll enjoy this one too. Would love to see him in more roles in the future. My sons have recommended so many wonderful Korean entertainers for me to take interests in. (Both Music/Acting. Thanks kids. Have a great day all. finally a male lead role for my kyungsoo plus he\\'s a prince Oppa fighting! I can\\'t wait to watch! hopefully it will hit big and cast will win awards with their acting. Cute poster<3<3<3 @dramaguy91.. same!!!!! I don\\'t usually like watching historical dramas but I think I\\'ll give this one a shot, especially because of NJH<3 I don\\'t usually watch dramas that has the time period as the Joseon Era however from the teasers, this looks like a good romantic comedy drama so I probably will give this a chance mostly because D.O is in here and I know how great of an actor he is. This drama was also like Nam Ji Hyun\\'s previous drama which is the Suspicious Couple where the main lead was a rich guy who have lost his memory and was found by Nam Ji Hyun, but this time, Its a Joseon version LMAO Nam Ji Hyun\\'s hair is styled to be someone who is alreadymarried during Joseon times and there was a wedding scene, so I\\'m assuming they got married and he lost his memory so when he came back to the palace, he forgot the face of his wife and someone else pretended to be his wife thats why he touched that woman\\'s lips?..or he could\\'ve already been married and lost his memory of him being a prince but his actions cannot lie and live a difficult life as a ordinary man during those 100 days and when he finally remembered, he came back to the palace and reminisce his time with her(second wife/true love) when he was reading and imagined seeing her with him. At this point, I\\'ll take Nam Ji Hyun however I can get her. D.O and Nam Ji-Hyun!! Cant wait for this drama! kyungsoo!!! i am trying not to watch kdramas but i will try this because of you:)) hwaiting! To honest TVN deserves MVP award for 2018. They did a lot of good drama. My heart is fluttering, this is really beautiful, can\\'t wait, hwaiting for all the actors n uri kyungsoo too hwaiting, hope the drama will be daebak!!! Im so excited.... I cnt wait sptmber any more??fighting uri kyungsoo!? I love Kyungsoo but the second is hella cute and there\\'s Nam Ji Hyun, lovely and good actress, shipable with any guy so I\\'m sure I\\'m going to be conflicted between the two guys don\\'t usually watch historical dramas but this has DO KYUNGSOO so of course i have to watch Go D.O .... Go D.O ..... Figthing Khungsoo ... Nam Ji Hyun who is she?? So Old!!! Haaaaa give up heroin is this young girl ... the writer is the same writer who wrote My lovely girl with krystal and rain...... honestly a huge fan of D.O. and I watch anything he comes out it, and i\\'m going to give this a chance, but i won\\'t be surprised if it doesn\\'t deliver.........i won\\'t be surprised if this fails either..... actually kind of expecting it.......... Fighting Actor Kyungsoo ❤❤❤ So excited for this drama!!! oh my goodness as an avid reader of kyungsoo au medieval times i might pass out watching this hahahaa fighting kyungsoo!! I like Nam Ji Hyun as an actress, but I wished she had passed on this one and taken another drama/role that\\'s different. According to other sites that I\\'ve read, the story is basically somewhat similar to one of her other dramas that she did, Shopping King Louis. That\\'s the one where the rich guy, Louis, has amnesia and becomes clueless and useless in the world. He then meets a nice girl named Bok-Sil (NJH) who takes care of him. Two differences are: this one is a historical and Seo In Guk is a much more established actor than DO. Nam Ji Hyun is a very good actress and if she continues to take on the same kinds of roles she is going to be typecast. She needs to do other challenging dramas/roles in order to keep improving on her acting. Having said that, I wish her well in this drama. Oh my goood, it\\'s been a long time that i\\'m waiting for saeguk drama, modern drama turn to be boring nowadays, and i just can\\'t wait this drama to be airiiiing.. omo! d.o in a lead role! my heart cant wait. so excited for this drama. hope it will have a great plot. Kyaaa....Do kyungsoo???can\\'t wait this first drama d.o play about the historical drama right? seriously I can not wait to see d.o in this drama> <whoever her female lead is not a problem for me, it is important to watch mini drama series d.o he prime become the main character. spirit d.o!!!!!! Aaaaaaa can\\'t wait......love kyungsoooo I hope this drama will have a happy ending.. I hate sad ending.. BTW I love D.O so much and the cast.. Fighting!!! Kyungsoo is my favourite Exo member and he has lots of potential when it comes to acting (best in Exo too) and I love Nam Ji Hyun. I just wish this wasn\\'t a historical drama >.< I cannot stand those at all because of the ugly hairstyles lol Looks like we will have to wait another year for Kang Joon and Ji Hyun. Actor Doh kyungsoo hwaiting ❤❤❤ Yayy! I love Nam Ji Hyun\\'s acting. She is just super talented and really cute and I always look forward to her dramas. But I\\'m weary of Han So Hee after seeing her in Money Flower; her cold, conniving and 2 faced character made me quite agitated so yes will wait and see when this drama is due to premiere to whether or not I add it to my must watch K drama schedule. The perils of \\'Do I watch for one of my favourite actresses?\\' Or \\'Give it a miss due to a co actor?\\' Hopefully I can overcome this delimma closer to the date and sit down and watch it without hesitation. i think it is running at the end of the year, maybe it will be aired in september? i\\'m so happy for this drama.. i hope both of them accept this offer. is this historical drama? or is there a part taken from the modern world as well? like Rooftop Prince drama:D Yeayy! Finally kyung soo first lead roles in drama!! I hope both of actress and actor accept the offered!!! Hope for that came true?? yay love both of them please pick fighting I waited for this asianwiki, just to see your post and to confirm if D.O will be the lead male waahhhh and I\\'m happy that he is considering for this positively. I can\\'t wait to see D.O in historical drama.',\n",

I\\'m from Nigeria and I watch every korean show and movie and guess what? OCN never disappoints!!!!!!..You guys make the best thriller and horror movies..When I see a movie by OCN, I always anticipate .You guys rock.For real??❤❤ season 2 please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A really really good kdrama. Very creepy too. Way better than the English film \\'The Nun (2018)\\'. Looks like Harry Potter in Korean version lol This drama was amazing! I watched all episodes within two days. I was completely hooked. This drama made me feel various emotions?? Not that type of jumpscare in every scene but this is surely creepy and its story really got some sense! It teaches us a lesson in an unusual way that all humans indeed possess desires within theirselves that can turn them in something scary and it also shows that in times, we have friends we can rely on. I acutally can\\'t believe that this drama can make me cry because of its horror genre but everything about Hwa Pyung is breaking my heart?? kudos to the everyone who created this drama! Its really one of the best and unforgettable! Damn Park Il Do....that\\'s gonna be the name which will always creep me out?? and OMG Jung Eun Chae! Even though she acts really tough here.... she\\'s really beautiful and when she cries...mah hart is breaking with her. I love the leads! Im really satisfied watching this till the end. The last episode makes me cry, what a precious message i got!!! oh damn not sure how i feel about the last ep aka the ending............ just doenst feel too satsifying??? BUT no doubt the entire drama is a very good one. and def no regrets watching it!! YASSSSSSSS finally finally found a drama that can satisfy my drama drought!!!! wanted to look for some light hearted romcom but look where i landed myself into. but no regrets for the handsome mateo and the really really engaging plot. youll not regret this!! (tho warning of gory scenes which i usually skip but sometimes it comes unexpectedly and i was so scarred lol) Season 2 please? Creepiest drama till date but the most interesting drama too ♥️? This drama is one of the best drama I’ve watched. Although it’s creepy and I had to hold my breathe sometimes, but the relationship is real, some scenes really made me cry (and I rarely cry even when I watched other genres), the story is good, their acting is good, the make up is good. i love 3 main characters. Just love this drama. This drama is one of the best drama I’ve watched.. aaaarrrgghhh.. although it’s creepy and I had to hold my breathe sometimes, but the relationship is real, some scenes really made me cry (and I rarely cry even when I watched other genres), the story is good, their acting is good, the make up is good. i love 3 main characters. Just love this drama. This drama is perfect. Korean people really don\\'t know what they should watch:D Kim Jaewook you are a blessing. Perfection I could just rewatch only for him. Definetly a must watch! I still can\\'t forget this drama thinking of it all the time I haven\\'t watched a lot of K-Drama these days, but this is definitely one of the best I\\'ve watched. Kim Jaewook is great, but it\\'s nothing surprising anymore. He\\'s always that good and I love that he has chosen wide ranged roles, main character or side characters, and has consistently prove himself to be amazing. On the other hand, I\\'m happy to watch Jung Eunchae grows on screen. Not many people enjoyed Dr. Frost and drama-wise it wasn\\'t the best drama esp compared to the amazing Webtoon. But Jung Eunchae was pretty good. I just hope she can explore more roles. Lastly, Kim Dongwook is just downright surprising. This is definitely his best acting project and I just hope that he got more and more interesting roles. Amazing. Just amazing. OMG! This is a reunited drama for Kim Dong-Wook & Kim Jae-Wook. I saw them both starred in \"Coffee Prince\" way back 2007 and I love them very much on how they portray their role up until now. Fighting:) It\\'s an OCN drama. OCN is a paid cable channel in contrast to KBS, MBC and SBS. OCN is even smaller than tvN. So the rating aggregrate is very high for an OCN drama. Final episode reached 4% in Nationwide AGB viewership rating share, which made it the 2nd most watched show that night. Remember cable TV shows rating aggregrate works differently to free networks. @San7 the ratings are considered high bcos it aired on pay TV which have smaller audiences compared to public/ free-to-air TV such as KBS, SBS, MBC etc. Wow this drama is underrated, I expected more ratings. I just finished watching it and its amazing Same. Kim Dong Wook has that special characteristic, it\\'s hard to not like him. I first noticed it in Along with the Gods 1, then the Concubine and now this. Very charismatic actor. Hope he keeps doing lead roles, he really suits it. Hands down one of the best “deeper than friendship” story ever told!!!! The first episode was so creepy I almost didn\\'t continue but the 3 main cast had me giving it another try. After that I never missed a single hour. Kim Dong Wook really impressed me and he made me keep watching. The female lead Jung Eun-chae was perfect too and the of course Kim Jae Wook. What an incredibly tense and well acted drama. Loved every single episode of it, and it had me on the edge of my seat throughout. Kim Dong Wook was incredible, I think it\\'s his best performance to date. He was the soul of the series. Without him I don\\'t think it might\\'ve been as good as it was. KIm Jae Wook and Jung Eun Chae were the heart of the show on the other hand, they both complimented Kim Dong Wook so well. While the narration was very good, the performances of the cast especially the three lead is what made the show so good. I\\'m hoping for a S2 so badly now. I know some things been unresolved like Park Hong Joo, so S2 would be very appropriate. And my hopes are high because it\\'s an OCN drama and OCN loves their sequel. Hope they\\'ll update us about a sequel soon, and hope all the cast return. I cannot envision the show without its wonderful cast. Best drama ever ever I highly recommend it Best Drama This 2018 For Me!!! From Save Me, I believe OCN will go far from creating horror-thriller dramas, and this drama is just..... amazing. Every episode is chilling.. I even cried in some episodes!!! Unbelievably dark and scary. You did a great job! I\\'ll miss the bunch but never Sohn. Hoping for Season 2 though, we still have Park Hong Joo! Excellent Thriller Drama ... Four Thumbs Up for the Director and Scenario Writer Best drama of the year. The 3 leads acted amazingly well & the scenario and cinematography were the best too <3 I want season 2!!! …but will I be able to handle my selfless babies to suffer again??? Great drama! Highly recommended!!?? Season two please! We want Park hong joo to fall down. This drama kinda reminds me with supernatural, sam even having vision in some cases. It\\'s a good drama though. Please Season 2!!!! With the same actors <3 pleeease super loved it!!! Masterpiece in my eyes Good movie very scary so far. But why my eye itchy now I think this is one of the best drama this year. The story is very interesting. The characters are very strong. I\\'ve been waiting for new episodes every week and sadly I had to part with it. I hope there will be more stories like this bcos there is no boring episodes even from the start to the last one. 3 word to express this drama: creepy, thrilling, amazing What an entertaining drama. Prolly the best of 2018 so far. Loved the characters and their interaction. Has an open ending, so I\\'m very hopeful that there\\'ll be a 2nd season some time in the future. It\\'d be brilliant. So sad this drama is ending. Loved everything abt the drama. Hoping for a season 2. And god I couldn\\'t believe who park I\\'ll do actually was at the end!!! hi. i liked this drama from the start and hoping for another season with the same actors. This only proves that you don\\'t need to have romance in the story to make it beautiful. This one is carefully written and brilliantly executed by the actors. I love every single episode. I wish to see more of this kind of drama, really tired of seeing cliché after cliché dramas. I\\'ll give this a 10/10 rating for the every single character portrayal, especially the possessed characters and 9/10 for the storyline! OMG this drama is something else , I love it and I wished that there is more epesiods , yon ha buyng?? , One of the greatest korean horror drama ever made. I\\'m usually really picky about what I watch but The Guest was really amazing and I have nothing bad to say about it. The actors, plot, mystery, soundtrack, everything was good. If you are a fan of horror, want something unique and like korean drama you should watch The Guest cause it won\\'t disappoint you. I\\'m really upset by the end of this series, The unpredictable end surprised me more than ever before, the author had a special place in the film, And each dialogue between roles followed a piece of story without making you tired and discouraged, I hope this series will receive special awards I will wait for The Guest Season 2 Wow! What I can say , a great drama.heartbreaking...everything is here... I loved this drama!!! The End of episode 16 I love watching the cast and everyone that was part of the drama. It was an amazing drama. 10/10 Thumbs up to the crew and the actors!!! I am from india and I can bet that I will never get an another tv series like The Guest........Man I loved everything about this show...the acting ,the direction, the camera work, the plot...everything......I am so sad that this show is in its last.........man..I love you OCN I hope kim dong wook can get an award for this drama. Good job to the team for making this drama!!! We all enjoy your hard work!!! The is story is very good. I do not expect this drama to be this good. one of the best kdrama... Love all 3 leads... Hidden boys love between Hwa Pyung and Mateo? OCN is getting really good! Congratulations to the writers! The writing is solid, and the story indeed touches on one reality that all darkness starts in the human heart. But there is always a solution, a light which may be in a form of religion, belief in a higher being, and/or trust and love for another human being. Congratulations to the actors too. The friendship of the three is palpable. There is no annoying budding romance resulting in a love triangle, whatsoever. Who needs one when the antagonist is as powerful as Park Il Do?:) :) :) But of course not as powerful as the belief for one\\'s ability to resist evil and love one\\'s family members and friends. watching drama but feels like i watching a Movie, Damn!!! Two thumbs up. This drama is great. I watch this coz of Kim Jae Uck but I like the actress and the bromance between two Kims. Hoping to see more. I swear I love this drama. It\\'s just so sad that most of OCN\\'s dramas don\\'t get the attention they deserve by the korean public. Everything about The Guest is nearly perfect; the plotting of the story, the phenomenal acting by the possessed people and the main cast with the goosebumps of a lifetime! Thumbs Up! For this Drama...watching at 1st due to Kim Jae Wook...but now luv the 3 leads...Good chemistry... Emily// I am a South Korean man. This drama is just fictional. There is no urban legend related to it. Amazing drama.no time for boring .kim jae wook\\'s acting is great. OCN never disappointed me. This is one of the best one yet! The chemistry of the three leads is awesome. The storyline is awesome. I watch the trailer because of Kim jae wook, didn\\'t know its gonna be this good. Hopefully they survive till the end and end park il do. great drama.the b e s t , The Guest------ Everybody Put your hands up????????????????????????????????? 10 thumbs up...... D . A . E . B . A . K!!!!!! My second adventure into the Korean horror genre - other than Train to Busan. After so many of the usual Kdramas, I was looking for something different - and I like it - a detective crime, horror, murder mystery - it makes you think. The best drama, you guys must watch this. Rate 10/10 ah ha priest yang is park II do, his soul is already corrupted for a long time and he got possessed at the same time with priest choi and he probably surrender both body ad soul to the devil park II do, a total possession thats why he can go to church and such but he doesn\\'t read the Bible, he has been playing the role of a priest in disguise so nobody suspect him. he probably will be on the run since he is already discovered so can\\'t play the role of a good priest no more, four more episodes, can\\'t wait. Do any of you guys know if this is based off an urban legend in South Korea or if this is purely fictional with no historical context? What a good show. Loving every moment of it so far. I like the chemistry between the three leads so much. i never can sleep at night after watch the drama. it was like i could see park ii do when my eyes closed. so scary but i cajt stop watching this drama. i really like the story and i cant stop thinking WHO IS PARK II DO! waiting for ep 13~❤️ Matteo is Park II Do Park II Do is operating through Hong Joo. I believe the call she made towards the end of episode 12 where she said she needs to take care of something makes it clearer. It was after that call that someone\\'s shadow walked into Kil Young senior\\'s hospital room and possessed him so that he will kill Kil Young. If they can successfully exorcise Detective Ko by next episode he will tell us who is Park II Do and I think it\\'s going to be Hong Joo. From the get go it is soooo evident that\\'s Ahn nae sang is park il do. Writers have to give a better twist than that. Yup ahn nae sang is park il do, from the ep -2 thats what I feel like. and if authors end up concluding so, as well then meh. Every hint is being given away that he is but the 3 leads suspect everyone except him, Park il do is the grandfather.. the body has to die in order to transfer his spirit into HP body.. it was grandpa that call HP father from the church.. grandpa has been raising HP well because he wants the body after the lady shaman seal wears off It is becoming more clearer now that Priest Yang could be Park II Do. @Jae i also think the same.. The spirits has probably lied and just trying to stop yun hwa pyung.. I think in the end there will be 1 on 1 fighting between yhp and park il do now I\\'m sure park II do is priest kang, he was possessed the first time he met Pyung, his mind is already corrupted a long time a go for him to get possessed. After seeing the congresswoman got chicken out and went to see priest kang. park II do took over his body and soul thats why he can go to church like a normal person, when Pyung was young and being possessed by park II do and the hold point of park II do trying to possess Pyung because of his power to see ghost but his family performed an exorcism which suppressed his power so park II do left his body and possessed priest kang, he then lying in wait for the day that Pyung regain his power to see ghost and plans to possess Pyung again, park II do targeted Pyung all this time. I think that park il do is priest yang, and he was waiting for the spell that the chaman did to hwa pyung to go back to his body. but it\\'s kind of hard for him to that when mateo and that cop is arround; that\\' why he\\'s trying to get rid of them. he want to kill the cop and make mateo weak so he can\\'t send him back to hell. If Park Il Do is inside Yoon Hwa Pyung or trying to possess him, the spirits won\\'t try to kill him. They try to make YHP stop chasing after Park Il Do, maybe because he has the power to stop him. Saying that everyone around him will die, maybe to make others leave him. Because they can be the key for YHP to release his power. Well, just my guess. this is getting complicated, but in a good way, make me wonder who the real park II do, one thing for sure is that park II do and the congresswoman are blood related, so park II do is her great uncle, and he has been helping her probably because they are the same, they have the same personality and both are killers. If park II do is Yoon Hwa-Pyung all along then that would be the biggest twist in this drama, with him seeing things whenever someone being possessed made me wonder if he really is park II do and park II do has been inside of him since he was young which allow pyung to see what actually happening when someone being possess. can\\'t wait for next episode, I need to know what is happening. I don\\'t thing there will be any romance between the three characters and hope there won\\'t be any, a drama can be good without any romance and this one should be a non-romance drama. This story give me a creeps everytime..whos park il do actually?perhaps his grandpa Out of all the ongoing shows, I felt Guest is the amazing drama, with horror genre! I\\'m completed hooked with this drama! I\\'m currently watching the smile left behind your eyes following with the beauty inside, but I vote 10/10 for guest since it doesn\\'t make you bored at any scene, you will try to anticipate what\\'s next! I already came to know about the spoiler in the smile left behind your eyes, and it\\'s completely sad and bitter truth, I want to discontinue but I couldn\\'t! Let\\'s hope atleast the script of ending would be different from Japanese version and the beauty inside is also one amazing drama! You\\'ll completely fall in love with that drama! But most of all, I loveddddd The Guest! Waiting for next episodes! This is one my fav drama for sure...Everything I luv about this drama... @diaxx wow you guess it correctly. Is therw any chance of a little romance bwtween matteo and gil young? Soory for being delusional Whoo!! This drama is really awesome! They’re so many suspects…who really Park II Do is? That congresswoman has a mean personality. I think she is related to Park II Do. Then, Priest Yang who has a connection with the congresswoman, and said about a total possession-that once possessed in a long time, you can live a normal life. What if he is hiding his true colors? And in the end, become possessed by the evil spirit—Park II Do. Or they have been searching for Park II Do the whole time, then turns out that it is Hwa-Pyung himself. So many twist…and I love how twisted the story is:D OCN never failed to surprised me or the viewers—great story plot. It almost 11 yrs after coffee prince for both main hero,glad to see them together again in 1 drama,? OCN always the best, makes me feel like im one of the detectives.. hahaha and i always end up in shock who really is Park II Do I love this drama, so scary and awesome. All actors are great especially jung eun chae is so gorgeous ❤ that priest is ma dehdy.:P 10/10 for thriller-horror Kdrama fans;) Ommo, im curious about Park II Do possesed who? I think the twist is PRIEST YANG!! I know OCN always make plot twist about the real murderer bcause The Tunnel make Doctor as Suspect murderer!! Great job OCN!! Pls watch this drama why people always love drama about romance. This thriller-horror drama makes you thinking like detective!! Awesome!!! This is the best among all the dramas that are airing at the same time now for me. It is the first drama that makes me forget to breath while watching. To me, i’ll rate it 10/10. well after watching episode 7 I believe that both priest yang and the congresswoman are with sketchy, by theory if the congresswoman is park ii do then she was possessed after she killed the girls and buried tho body, that is when she met priest Choi\\'s older brother and being possessed during that time, so she wasn\\'t possessed before because priest Choi\\'s bother is being possessed at he time, so when she killed the girl she wasn\\'t possessed by park ii do, then how come the school guard saw park ii do at that time. since she has an evil personality so she can be possessed by other evil spirits or she made a deal the the evil park ii do. priest yang is another candidate for park ii do possession, he seem very fishy, according to what he said, when a body is possessed completely which mean the devil took control over the body and the soul, in cases like that the person who was fully possessed can go to church and so on, so if he was possessed completely then he can still function normally and live normal without being suspect. even though park ii do can possesses many people but he will always go back to the body that most compatible to him and the one he has total control. I think I like Choi Yoon the most in this drama because he always so calm and rational, while Yoon Hwa-Pyung and king kil-young are hot tempered so sometimes these to can get on my nerves, the fact that he came to see the congresswoman with a knife and intended to kill her with a bunch of bodyguards around show how hot tempered he is, he has no plan and doesn\\'t think it through at all. they are dealing with evil spirit and a politician at that, so they need to plan through and through and execute it wisely. I hope the last episode make me jumpscare Does anyone know the songs that appear in the series?? “Hand: The Guest”, a witty and well-crafted love letter to horror tropes, is a barnstormer of an entertainment, a fairground ride with dodgy brakes. I highly recommend this drama, you won\\'t regret watching it. Whoa! Epic n just the best drama going right now! Episode 6 was gut wrenching and this drama keeps layering the suspense and intensity; every minute without a moments pause. I don’t know how many times I’ve had to remember to keep breathing whilst watching. Jung Eun Chae is nailing her character as far as I’m concerned and I don’t see ‘cute’ in her characterisation at all. She’s just very hardened and stoic in nature and I empathise with her. In fact I got a tad bit emotional and she’d a few tears in the flashbacks so she must be doing something right to move me emotionally. Kim Jae Wook and Kim Dong Wook compliment each other in their acting styles so yep this is working out so well it’s getting better each episode. Special mention to all the ‘possessed’ actors I’m seriously freaking out watching them and when Kim Dong Wook says ‘Don’t look at their eyes!’ I listen and follow suit. OCN you did it again! Well done on scoring The Guest! remember in episode 4, when hwa pyung didn\\'t realize that a guy being possessed.. Park Il do said the guy allowed being possessed.. and i think Priest Yang is a heir of Park Il Do.. Does anyone knows the song in episode 6 at +/- 40:40 - 43:10? @tim i have the same thought as u. At first i think it was just coincidence but if u look at the possessed dad at the first eps and the man from repair shop they all have the books of the priest yang. Since the first eps they have mentiones that there must be a media which make them possessed something is very fishy about that priest yang\\'s organization, whoever involved with his church got possessed, I\\'m sure the politician lady is possessed too, the man in the wheelchair and the girl in episode 5, they are all members of his church (the helping hands), i think priest yang is possessed by park II do, also priest Choi\\'s body is buried under ground even though he committed suicide, someone must have buried him after he died, I think that priest yang got possessed and buried choi. Park II do is not the only evil spirit possessing people but there are more, the one that got possess by park II do always drink a lot of water, but the one got possess by other evil spirits don\\'t drink water, it\\'s like those evil spirits are park II do underling. I do agree with mimoo that the character kang kil young doesn\\'t suite Jung eun chae, just my personal feeling, wonder how its turn out if it is a male character instead of female, she is a very good actress, its just the role doesn\\'t suite her. i love the drama, but i personally think that jung eun chae doesnt suit the character, she is too cute to be fierce. So daebakk! ..it just make me always cant wait for the next episode. Staying in the village now while watching the KDRAMA especially produced by OCN is really make me relax and chillaxx..SarangHae from Kudat, Sabah. North Borneo gaiss. I really like drama from ocn. And I recommend this drama❤️❤️❤️?????? @The Wicked Wizard of the Worst comment below: PERFECTLY SAID. Couldn\\'t have expressed the intelligence of this drama better! The Guest is a professional jitters-fest, made with deep-seated esteem for the genre rather than cynicism about the ratings sure thing. OCN produced a really great drama! So good!!!!! Finally a real scary kdrama. I love the sound effects and the acting is great. Keep it up!! seriously amazing , its creepy and scary , dont watch at night! Daebak Loved the first two episodes!!! I\\'m a fan of horror genre, and horror fans out there shouldn\\'t miss this! It is must watch! Both the episodes were super interesting, waiting for the next episode(this is the reason why I don\\'t like to watch ongoing episodes, I\\'ll die with suspense? This drama is so great @wayer I agree with you September must be the spooky months because all of the horror dramas..I\\'m currently watching all the 3 dramas..Lovely Horribly,The Ghost Detective and this drama The Guest..and this drama is the top of all three..it\\'s way too horror and dark..if you don\\'t a have a strong heart please don\\'t watch this during the night..btw OCN dramas never disappoint ..from The Voice 1&2,Black,Tunnel and many more.. The Guest makes other kdrama horror inspired, a big joke! This is the real thing, not your typical half-baked horror drama. Everyone in this drama are doing an excellent job especially the \"possessed\" actors. Highly recommended!!! Such a good story, about a powerful demons with only have one eyes.. we called “dajjal”..manipulate people with he power,great storyline OCN,OCN never been disappointed chanel to follow.. August and September must be the spooky months! Lovely Horribly, Ghost Detective and now The Guest. Muchos horror.. and Kim Jae Wook is back! Sheer Brilliance!!! You know when a K drama has you hooked especially when it’s on OCN and for an hour you’re unable to breathe until the credits roll. There is nothing to find fault with and it ain’t for the faint hearted. From the main cast to supporting actors this is why ‘The Guest’ is the pen ultimate horror/thriller/mystery drama that is leading the way - sorry to ‘Lovely Horibly’ and ‘The Ghost Detective’ but OCN ‘The Guest’ is where it’s at. Enjoy? Awesome drama! Though it brought me chills down the spine! Haha But nevertheless it’s a very good start! We’ll keep following these one! Great and from main and supporting cast...there\\'s no time to rest watching from early ep...look forward for next eps and duel with park il do!! Daebak, amazing, awesome, fantastic and will definitely go down as one of 2018\\'s best drama. Kim Jae Wook never disappoints. He always brings his A-game in any drama. One word for this drama, AMAZING! Nice story Line 2 thumbs for this drama?????? Just watched the episode 1 & 2, now I can\\'t wait for the following episodes!!! It\\'s damn good & interesting to see different religion does exorcism. For once I thought I was watching a movie because the storyline, special effects, sound effects etc: is different from the usual supernatural/horror dramas. GREAT WORK to the cast & crew of Hand:The Guest! look like this one is good, OCN never disappointed, this is just too creepy, kind of like the exorcist Korean style, still good though. This is bad for the heart watching at 2 in the morning, guys don\\'t watch this too late into the night, won\\'t be able to sleep. this is so thrilling right now that I just can\\'t wait for next week, I want episode 3 now. I think this is the scariest drama from OCN so far, save me is more like a cult kind of drama but this one is just straight out horror, for though who don\\'t like horror, this is not for you, if you couldn\\'t get pass save me then this will be tough since it is much scarier, but give it a try, I like it. park il do literally looks like choi hongman .. that little clip in ep 2 58~ minute in Omg, just finished the first episode, and i must say, it\\'s hella scary! Still, the cinematography\\'s really good! Can\\'t wait for more episodes! Ocn top drama Had watched 1st episode (even though i did thought about drop in the middle,but however forced myself to finish....)....story so far great, but scary...if you\\'re fans of ghost story or exorcism story...probably can suggest you to watch. I watch this drama but this one is too scary. I can\\'t even finished the first episode ._. Cant wait I see Kim Jae-Wook\\'s name in a drama..I\\'m in. No questions ask! lmao! Excited for this one! yahoooo! Typical OCN Drama. Dark, Mysterious, Gritty. Sometimes I cant finish this type of drama, just like children of Lesser God, Save Me. But I will try this one. OCN really love Jung EunChae hahahaha It gave me goosebumps... This is like the anime i\\'ve seen before, Ghost hunt i really love that anime .. im going to watch this!! Yass!! Omo?. I really excited, can\\'t any longer Love me some OCN dramas? OCN dramas are so good!!! I can’t wait they are the best \"The Guest\" is the first OCN drama series to air on Wednesdays and Thursdays. They were both in coffee prince yassssssssssssss cuteeeeeeeeeeee OCN and TVN really loves Jung EunChae hahaha Kim Jae Wook as the priest! Daebakk... Can not imagine it..... Remind me to his role as Mo Tae Goo in Voice....... cant waittt ❤ fighting jaewook oppa! Oh my gosh om my oh my... Kim jae wook opppaaaaaaaaaa @CKW, Mirror of the witch on jtbc is horror. They deal with shaman too. Oooh nice premise Wonder if this is a horror thriller or a horror comedy though. I don\\'t see the genre horror working in dramas in Korean industry unless horror comedy. Good news...I love love these actors..very beautiful and talented cast ♡♡♡♡♡ I\\'m still not over kim jae wook as a killer in voice, and now this!!! yay finally nara have a lead role.. love her in return..

       "  'comments': 'Just an unbelievable ending-how can Doran and her ex get back together, after all the abuse heaped on her? Does every show HAVE to have a happy ending? I think the majority of the audience would have been happy to see Doran with Taepoong, especially when he is a prince in disguise. This episode should have happened many episodes ago, so that we could have seen the Chairman\\'s family fall apart with divorce, anger, and regret over what they did. Well, on to the next drama....... Happy ending.... but I\\'m disappointed that Do Ran and Dae-Ryook get back together. I wanted see more regret moments and begging for forgiveness from Daeryook\\'s family for the way they treated Do Ran and her father. Poor Taepoong. He\\'s good looking. Grandmother dementia was a bit much at times - fast forward. But overall, I really did enjoyed this drama. Sad it ended. My only one is also my only ally. Basically the man with no family lose his wife and then his daughter when framed. She is his only one at the start of the series. It had to with the beginning and not the end. The ex spent his time divorced clearing her father and standing up for them to his cousin. Waiting for translations to make sense out of the scenes I saw. Absolutely ridiculous for Do Ran and Daryook to get back together. What are the writers thinking about? Never cried so much in my live, i\\'m bearded man damn it!!!! really enjoyed this. thank you uee, a heartwarming character. Such a lot hair pulling in his drama especially from Da Ya and grandma Geum Byung,,,,,, Well done family drama that resulted in many happy children Such as happy ending for Do Ran. I really hope DR and DRyook will doesn’t get back together they are zéro chemistry i never been touched by their love story. Mr. Kang burned Chairman Wang on their conversation when he said that the Chairman knew DoRan & DaeRyook love each other but he forced them to separate & get divorced. Now that, it Mr. Kang\\'s name got cleared they insist on getting them back together even if the mother is against it. It shows how low they think of DoRan, they only want her out of convenience, they see her as a caregiver not a family member. Regardless of how much DaeRyook loves DoRan if he can\\'t protect her from this toxic family, they shouldn\\'t get back together. DoRan deserves better. Also, title is My Only One doesn\\'t mean DoRan\\'s Only One is DaeRyook. Her only one is her father. She stood by him through all the hardships. It is a story of father-daughter relationship, so it\\'s better for DoRan to remain single or marry Taepung than the writers force DoRan & DaeRyook getting back together. As ending, I hope they show how a woman values herself more than just being attached to love or man. It\\'s true what Doran father said she wouldn\\'t be happy with a mil who doesn\\'t like her. Too many painful moments. They only think about themselves except daeryok. But I can see how much they love each other Poor Daya! She is so quick to notice anything about Doran, but she can\\'t see what\\'s going on with her husband right under her nose. I think her dream to inherit Bom and Food is not going to happen... If Doran&dae ryook will get back together it will not be a happy one. Dae Ryook\\'s mother will make sure of than. Too many heartbreak between families. They might have forgiven but not forgotten. Taepoong will be better for Doran. She will a chance of happiness with him and also I think that he\\'s more richer the that family. What Dae Ryook did for her dad was good but little to late. Once in a while a drama comes along that moves me, not so much the storyline but every actors play their roles perfectly, I get lost in their artistry, this is one of those wonderful dramas that I wish would not end. @BayetteY, Hong Ju didn’t just pregnant after marrying one day, lol! You know it’s not possible!! Remember she had a night with Kang after she decided she didn’t want to leave Kang? It was that night the magic happened!! I love this show! I kind of knew that the ending of the show was coming. My understanding is March 17,2019.I like almost all the characters. Dee Shook should move out from his parents house to live independent. I really like Do Ran. restraint and management of her. emotion she could have cling and out burst for Do shook.. Day a, she is not playing a good person on the show, but her acting is brilliant. She plays well as a spoil daughter and concern about herself.She is kind of cute the she acts.She does know how to please her self.Thats for sure. I can go on and on about each characters. When I watch this show all of my emotions are moved and touched. For example,when Dee ryook show up at do send father house after divorce and drunk,my heart was breaking up for the pain he was going through. It\\'s great show! Everyone should be pregnant. Some kids would make the grownup happier and better behaved. There has been so much loss of family it would end well grow the families. I also agree Do Ran is pregnant. Remember she had dizzy spells? Don’t forget DoRan is pregnant I think yi ryook & daya will divorce, cause yi ryook cheating her. The rating hit 49% WOW! Congratulations to My Only One cast. The drama is super good. Come on I hope for a Super Ending. Back in September it reached 1st with 25%. Something is odd with the numbers. I enjoyed my golden much better. Another record breaking rating, at 49.4, higher than My Golden Life! They deserve it. I watched the recent Happy Together episode, the cast is like a family. They are so nice and supportive of each other. Congratulation. The ex husband was the one to clear everything. He was helpful to his former better half. Uee\\'s crying scenes made me cry as well.. T_T I was hoping for better ending ep 102 DR finally finds out her father is innocent. That begger/loan shark made me so mad when he kept on lying. It\\'s okay for innocent DR to live as a murderers daughter but NOT his own SON. He should have just told them the truth 5 to 10 episodes ago. I really want to see some happy scenes with DR & DK reunion and HongJoo & SooII and their baby. To be honest when Grandmother\\'s dementia appeared again when she was at the hospital was a very tough to watch especially when SooII was yelling at her Family. Ep102 had me in tears. My eyes are puffy now. I love this Drama so much.. Every episode I\\'ve watched I can\\'t help but cry...:( More power.. To the cast and crew. ❤️ ❤️ Not satisfied with the outcome yes esp 102 finally revealed the real murderer How about a musical for a happy ending??? Incredible! No complications for Go Rae on his first liver transplant y kirigoo he was as strong as a horse and Mr Kang just happened to stay in a coma. Doctors just happened to did a perfect match!!! To the writers please Stop making DaeRyook & DoRan get back together! The guy clearly has no balls to stand up for the person he loves. He\\'s always been controlled by what his parents say & fears what others will say of their family. DoRan doesn\\'t need a coward man, she needs someone who can stand by her through highs and lows. I\\'m more pissed about this than the witches DaYa, HongShil, EunYoung & YangJa combined! My favorite is geum byung when she has dementia. She is really cool Goodness!! Get a grip... it’s just a drama MiRan isn’t like her mother. Give her a try. I want to see this drama but I have no faith in Uee\\'s acting. I\\'m excited for the cast\\'s guesting on Happy Together. Got more excited with the preview of DoRan and MiRan dancing since they promised to return when ratings hit 35%. I really really don\\'t want Dr to get back with her ex husband. Pls with the new hot guy I really can\\'t stand. Miran I just can\\'t even look at her. I already didn\\'t like the actress but was willing to give her a chance.. But no both character and actress are so annoying. I skip all her parts She may be the missing MyeongHui? That\\'s an interesting idea! The age will be right. I wonder if that will be the missing sister? Na Moon Hee. Hated Wang’s Family. How odd to suddenly put it out there so many years old? Thank goodness for laurel tree tailors or I would still hate that actress. The priest referred him to the family. Perfectly respectable people with family can’t do that kind of work. Keeping secrets. Beck and call all hours. Grandma is the best judge of character and she is the one who made the decision. I\\'m watching \"Wang\\'s Family\" early in the morning on KBS, and I notice that Na Moon Hee (the old grandmother ) is also in this drama, but I haven\\'t noticed her-is she a character we haven\\'t seen yet? I\\'m quite amused of how fast compatibility for organ donation is in Korea, also without the consent of the donee & family you can test if it matches. What annoys me is that the writers are forcing a reconciliation for DoRan & DaeRyook. For goodness sake, the guy can\\'t protect her from his family. He always make threats that he\\'ll live with DoRan and grandma but doesn\\'t do it. He got no balls at all he can\\'t even say no to his mother pairing him with new girl. Also, it\\'s time to put TaePung on the scene. Most of the time he\\'s on the background. We need to know more about him than just being a display lol. First off they took her to a random grave. Second her sister is the age in her mind where she is much younger. That is how it works. I’d love to know what really happened to the sister. I\\'m sorry, but this dementia angle is getting played out. She wants to die because her sister died. That happens, but they should have her properly mourn, and live on. Congratulation, another record high rating, over 46%. Exchange for gorae mother to forgive doran Father transplant is the solution..but in the end they will find out that doran Father is not the killer.. When I watch this drama I couldn\\'t help but tears up...one of my fave.. In Korean high school you either take social studies or science and not both. I would not trust a Korean writer to be anywhere near accurate about medical stuff. It is possible to have liver disease without drinking. It’s a lovely PSA for organ transplant. Perhaps Go Rae does not have all the symtoms of liver damage, Please happy ending, Doran and her father deserves to live happy after all these yearsㅠㅠ Was the divorce registered? Does the 3 month period exist still? Ok divorces were completed because of DAYa’s accusations about killing her father. Grandma was always nice to them. Is it just me or that daya b*tch is getting on everyone’s nerve. She always jumps to conclusions w/o definite proof! And her mom along with Doran’s mother-in-law and stepmom always whining, oh poor me! Can’t wait to see all these stupid people drop on their knees begging for forgiveness when they find out that Mr Kang is innocent. Do not make Mr Kang give Gorae the organ! He suffered enough already! Make that old man confess and end up giving Gorae the organ for taking his father’s life. Maybe Doran should end up with Tapoong since he genuinely cares for her, Dayreok alone for being a whimp, Yireok divorces Daya, Soyoung moving. The grandma stays in the nursing home but she can see Doran whenever she wants so Doran does not have to see her ex in-laws faces ever again. Mr Kang with Hongjoon live in America away from the whiny sister! Is Daya ever going to be punished? How does she get away with everything? She\\'s the one causing people to fight and fall apart. daya is getting on my nerves... aish!??? Daya be like “Breadtalk na lang kayo!” (“Just go to Breadtalk!”!) Aaaacckk... i hate that Wang family still gives trouble to Doran!! Even if it is for the grandma, how could they asked Doran to take care of the grandma after they made her divorce her husband??! Theyre so shameless!! They keep on saying Doran and her father are so shameless, but they are the one who were being SHAMELESS!! This drama made my blood boil.. >:( It\\'s good that grandma lives with Do Ran again,,,, I wanted Doran to marry Daeryook but now I think Taepoong will be better for her. He really care abour her but Daeryook couldn\\'t even protect her or do anything for her. He was only watching. And I hope Iryook will divorce Daya because she\\'s all about money, mean and arrogant. Good that Miran have good and caretaking husband like Gorae. Please just give Hongjoo finally to be happy with Mr. Kang, she\\'ll be a really good step mother for Doran. I don’t want mr. Kang to give anything for Gorae It\\'s too bad that Wang Dae Ryook couldn\\'t or wouldn\\'t protect Doran from his family. He has a lot to learn from Tae Pung. I think Go Rae is going to need a liver transplant and Kang Soo-il is going to give him one of his -- saving Go Rae\\'s life. This would change the whole dynamics of the hatred for Mr. Kang. Part of me think grandma is milking this to get Doran and hubby back together. Loved the police station scene. You can be charged with a mess of stuff lady.. Okay Doran is grandma keeper. we can see partly what really happened on the day Daya\\'s father death. Who is the actor who portrays Taepoong, Suil’s assistant in the bakery? Is he also Lee Suho from Left Handed Wife? Go Rae has more backbone than Dae Ryook so Mi Ran is lucky than she has a husband who\\'ll protect her & fight for them being together. Now that we see a glimpse of Tae Pung\\'s background I\\'m rooting for him and Do Ran more but seems like Do Ran will be sucked again into the blackhole of her ex in-laws due to the Grandma. I\\'m all up for her helping the Grandma but I hope it ends there, no more attachment to her ex husband & family. From episode 90 it seems that the homeless man was responsible for killing Da Ya\\'s dad accidentally, I wonder if he would confess on a later episode to free up Do Ran\"s dad. Or would he commit suicide. While everyone was wondering who the real killer is if Mr. Kang is really innocent.. i was wondering why was Daya and Gorae\\'s father there in the loan office in the first place? Was he going to visit someone or going to loaN money? did he knew the lady there working in the office? @Rosalie wha?! Why would Taepung is Hongjoo\\'s son?.. i thought Hongjoo was betrayed by her first husband then married her second ameeican husband, Freddie?.. hmm.. I love this drama. I look forward to it every week but some things have me baffled. Isn’t it assault to hit people with eggs and cut people in their faces. Shouldn’t these people be arrested who threw assault materials? And also that Da Ya—-Can Do Ran and Mi ran tell her off and put her in her place. Writer. Help please‼️‼️ My opinions - Jae poong is very wealthy and he is Hong joo’s Son. Anyone agree? I can\\'t watch episode 87-90, it\\'s too hard for me to watch all pain. I know it will happen, but still it\\'s so hard... I hope all will getting better next week. Fighting Mr. Kang and Do Ran!!! What? No CCTv on the street or in the store? I cried when the grandma was sent to the nursing home.. maybe if i were also to send my parents there i would die from being heartbroken.. T_T From what is shown in ep90, I think there’s another person who’s the real murderer. The homeless man (running the loan office) was the witness but was probably paid during the trial 28 years ago and pointed Mr. Kang as the killer. Mr. Kang was then also hit and bumped so he couldn’t remember exactly what happened. DRAMAQUEEN I find it odd that the family would not know of a release from prison. What an odd country or a writer who studied too much, has too many connections and hasn’t lived a real life. They should have moved house and the business after. No way they could have peace staying put. I wish the eldest moved out with his wife. I can see how she can’t live with the SIL. I don’t understand how 50 something’s can have say in their adult children’s marriage/divorce. Quit the multigenerational living. Doran\\'s dad went to prison, so there was a trial and sentencing and probably news coverage.... but the mother, sister and brother don\\'t know who the killer is or what he looks like until now??? LOL, so silly Okay the father and husband finally divorced. SCROLL PASS IF YOU DON’T WANT TO SEE SPOILERS. I also agree with Ddii. i really think Mr. Kang is not the real killer of Day\\'s father. I\\'m thinking its the homeless old man knows something or he could be the true killer not Mr. Kang. That old man seems to be guilty of something. While it is understandable that in-laws want to cut ties/divorce Do Ran and Mi Ran but when a husband can not protect his wife and choose to divorce her or let her suffer the ugly attitude of your own parent/s he is not man deserving to be married at all. That is why I\\'d rather have Do Ran end up with Tae Pung or stay single and Mi Ran to meet someone who can protect her. They\\'re both innocent and have nothing to do with what happened in the past (even if that past is uncertain if real or not). I just don\\'t understand why can\\'t they move out of their parents\\' houses and have their own home where they could build their own families peacefully away from meddling in-laws. A man who can\\'t protect his wife got no balls & should nevet be allowed to marry, NEVER! Writer and director it’s all new people in the cast. Who is the guy work in bakery with Mr. Kang, Taepoong? His real name I agree with you Ddii, on the face it may seem like Mr Kang killed Daya\\'s dad but the truth is yet to be revealed. I think Daya\\'s mother may be involve with her father\\'s death, at Gorae\\'s wedding she said to forgive her for her sins. I want Mr. Kang and Hongjoo end up together. i believe mr. Kang is innocent and didnt kill Daya\\'s dad! To the scripwriter, i hope Mr Kang won’t end up with Hong Joo, how inconsiderate knowing that Mr. Kang murdered Hong Joo’s brother-in-law. I cant bear to watch the next episode anymore.. T_T Finally...I can\\'t wait for next week episodes! I feel bad for director wang, he loves do ran so much but things are just complicated.... Hoping for a nice ending??? Bravo Lee Jang-Woo stand up and take a bow. Great acting. So at the end they didn\\'t get divorced. As Doran said there is no secret that won\\'t be found out. I think it\\'s a decision that both her and the husband will regret. Now daya \\'s uncle is back,as we know he was the one attending the court for Doran dad murder.. So things will definitely get more complicated. Regarding her dad and hongjo I am glad they separated, honestly I didn\\'t buy the romance and she is one of the family of the victim her sister\\'s husband. And the don\\'t look good together. The best thing of this whole drama is geum byung aka grandma.. She is so cute!!!! Seeing how Daya\\'s mom behave toward Mi-Ran, I now totally got it where Daya\\'s such attitudes came from. Like mother like daughter. Hahaha. I agree with Doc that’s the plot line is ridiculous. The story is very good,every episode is exciting,all in all it is not boring.We have not yet seen the last episode and we are hoping that it is a happy ending. The ultimate makjang experience with the most ridiculous plot line ever I actually wish Doran will get away from her husband\\'s family and get divorced. Gets with the new guy and live happily. Also she was a good student so continue her studies and get a good work. I feel bad for daeryok but their relationship is making Doran unhappy.. Marriage is not just about love.. So yeah.. It\\'s better for them to separate. Daya is a f*cking snake.. I hope she experience the same pain she caused Doran.. Also her mother is so wicked and two faced. Like mother like daughter. Also the loveline of Doran dad is kinda weird to see. I always skip it. i sometimes feel tired seeing Do Ran and her dad cry all the time and can\\'t even have happy life, i wish that new guy is a ran away chaebol, only son of richest family the will help Do Ran have decent and job and then Mr. Kang will become rich ..my heart can\\'t take any more sad moments for Mr. Kang. Since the main characters here are only Mr. Kang and Do Ran. Currently the best drama this season! I love the cast... Uee, Lee Jang Woo always my favorite and I almost forgot Go Rae & Miran caught my attention. And, Halmeoni, you\\'re the best! Ok got it the storyline and drama is about forgiveness. The mystery guy who brought Doran to the hospital was the guy from Father is strange right? Doran will be kick out AGAIN and will be force to divorce her husband when the time comes her mother in law will find out about her father\\'s criminal record.. and that new guy will fall in love with Doran! I actually wish he will save Doran from all her suffering from Daeryook\\'s family..:( but i also feel sorry for Daeryook.. uggh, i also just wish Doran and her father will live together somewhere far away and no one will find them.. THATS THE END FOR ME! Story line tonight was hard to follow, both Mr.Kang and Director Wang left the hospital sleep in bed from being kicked out of the house. Then Mr. Kang was drinking in a tent bar then left his phone. Very confusing as Ms Kim was then kick out of the house again. this drama is okay but the gay storyline is pretty dumb and contrived. also the Mom\\'s overacting/overreactions are way over the top. otherwise its a decent drama. OMG Do Ran has to deceive her mother-in-law again. New characters and story is turning into something different? I think I figured it out the man that took Do Ran to the hospital is the man that knows Mr. Kang son. So Do Ran will definitely see him again. Love triangle his family will accept her for who she is and she will experience more happiness and her husband will do anything to get her back but his mother is still the same. If someone has another point please comment. I agree that Mr. Kang will fall into some money and the guy that took Do Ran to the hospital will meet her again. I also see that Do Ran\\'s mother in law will try to get her to come back and she will not unless things change for good. I hope things start looking up for Do Ran and Mr. Kang. I\\'m tired of the crying I want to see happiness in both of their lives. If things don\\'t change soon I think the 40% will go down quick. Do Ran keep fighting! @Dee his name is Song Won Seok Can someone tell me whats the name of the guy who brought Doran to hospital? Will the guy who found Do Ran and brought her to the hospital become a third wheel since Do Ran will agree to divorce Dae Ryook? I think Kang ahjusshi will become rich since the guy he helped in prison will help him. There will be turning of events. I just hope Kang sem and Hong Joo will become a couple soon if things go well. Also the Chairman should scold Daya for not listening and revealing the secret. It\\'s like she did not respect his orders and is purposely trying to ruin their family. An excellent drama, well written and everyone acted so well. I hope Mr. Kang will eventually found innocent for his crime. I have been addicted to this drama and can\\'t wait for next week for it to be shown! It\\'s no surprise the latest rating reached 40%!! Right DoRa should leave and break up because of her weak self. This drama is just so amazing in the sense that it reminds yous to be nice to all people as you don\\'t know how circumstances you have with them in the future! Amazing job to the writer and director and to the actors. I just love it that I can\\'t wait to know what\\'s going to happen next! Please upload the next episodes as soon as possible! I\\'m so tired of Daya and the mother in law. Not understanding at all. I\\'m tired of this drama due to there is no joy for Do Ran. She\\'s always crying and apologizing. Since she\\'s getting thrown out in the cold she should finish school and become a great lawyer. Daya is so mean spirited. I hope Do Ran starts being happy and enjoying her marriage. I agree!!! The grandma must get and award too. I agree both the daughter in law and mother should not be given an award. The real best actress was grandmother. omg i hate daya so much can she like idk disappear????? Doran makes me so frustrated. Why she keep having a date with her father, I mean I know she just knows the truth. But she\\'s so childish just like Daya. But I guess this is what the writer-nim wants. I\\'ll just wait for Daya\\'s worst episodes and her father in law too. I hope the grandma\\'s dementia will be worse, so he cant do anything without Kang Sooil. *evil laugh* Sometimes the supporting couple is better than the main couple. I really love watching Kim Mi-Ran and Jang Go-Rae scenes. There really cute together. Love korean drama series, And I love My only one.. Philippines fan.. Yeah evil in ER with no money and the woman left saying don’t bother calling! Yay! I keep checking to see if it got better. This is no my golden life. Uee would be so rich if she\\'d just take the money here and in Marriage Contract. LOL I don’t now why in keep watch this drama This is the worst weekend kbs drama ever.. Every female character in this drama is stupid... Include the main actress charactor.. Very disappointing.. Guys is it me or Doran husband is getting fatter every episode he didn\\'t use to be this chubby what is happening wooah. Don’t know how the show will be able to last up to 100 episodes. Every time I see da ya and eun young (daughter-in-law and mother-in-law), I want to puke. They’re like high school rebels! Especially the mother-in-law, always ranting about what’s wrong w do ran. I wish the grandma would just slap her and put her in her place already! The chairman is weak! Just tell your wife to shut it or better yet, divorce her! Also da ya’s mom, is she that clueless about her daughter, who’s only after money and status! Her (da ya) plastic face is so ugly to look at that I have to cover the screen. Hopefully, the show will end soon. Enough problems w the in-laws already! Kick eun young and da ya out! YES!!! Good morning from MN, everyone. I am disappoint of Kim Do ram her humble get me annoying me a lot and she still her husband director oh my god give me patient the only is given me still these drama is Na Hong joo and her love kang soo Il , I like the way she rich but the money is not given her in their brain she doesn\\'t care what the people say she have good energy and vibes I wish Do Ran meet her so Hong joo more respect for herself I mind Do Ran The secrets finally revealed one by one.. The tension just begun. I\\'m so curious for what will happened in next episode. I\\'m so afraid for the (possibility) sad ending though. I just love Kang Soo il... And daya needs serious beating by ( her mother in law if possible) lolz. When will this mess be over? @Jamse it was explained in the first episode that she did go the trial and sent her brother on her behalf because she was too full of spite, that\\'s why she cannot recognize Mr.kang All characters in the drama are really good in acting. They show a very good facial expressions. Best wishes for the show. SPOILER I know that dramas have a tenuous connection to real life at best, but the meeting between Mr. Kang and Hong-sil is a head scratcher. He killed her husband and she had to have been at his trial. But neither of them have a clue who the other is? This drama reminds me of crazy rich\"\"\"\"\"\"\"fill in the blank. Exceptional storytelling!This one is up there with the best KBS family dramas and reminds me a bit of My Daughter Seo Young a bit.It started slowly but now have come to love the characters..Choi Soo Jong ,Uee,Lee Jang woo and Park Sang Woo are especially impressive in their characters.This was my first time seeing Lee Jang Woo in a lead and he has created an effortless ease around him and I look forward to all his scenes .Choi Soo Jong and Uee are the actual central characters of daughter and father and are superb in their roles. I\\'m enjoying this drama! Love the main leads & the chemistry of my current favourite couple, Jangwoo & Uee is amazing. Hope Daeryook will try his utmost to get Doran back, he needs to know the truth. Waiting to see what happens I am really loving it. Is it me or this episode is the most exciting one I can\\'t wait for next week!! What will happen to Doran?!?! Ugh Daya is such a spoiled brat and the mother looks down on people what the heck. Anyway really good acting. I hope the Chairman finds out and beat the hell out of Dae Ryook\\'s mother and the jealous annoying Da Ya. I hope the Grandmothers disowns them too and protects Do Ran. You got me hooked! Jangwoo is well chosen for this role. Uee is getting so good! Cannot stand the jealous SIL. Jang\\'s mitger superb acting Just watched episode 40. Yeah, I cried. Everyone you saw that was coming to give him back his ring? I\\'ve been watching and up to ep 36. I like the interactions so far especially between Uee and the grandmother. Too often the young and old dont connect in dramas, so Im happy to see this. I\\'m also glad that Uee plays a regular woman struggling with family and work. Finally she meets someone who likes her and its hard for her to believe since her family is crazy and her Dad has passed. Her real dad is coming on to strong imo. Also why does it seem that his skin has shadows in every scene? I guess the writers want her m to be seen as evil. So Yang-Ja and her d. n. l. are the evil ones. Uggh, so whining and lookeding down on everyone. The ridiculous Jang Daya and the childish mother in-law are starting to get to my nerves. These two women ruined the drama. I\\'m starting to believe that Daya\\'s father must have done something wrong that makes someone want to kill him. But Daya\\'s brother is a decent man. How can she grow up becoming a pain in the arse???? i was hoping to finish this drama but i ended up dumping it by epi 16 the story line is interesting and seems ok but so far all the dramas that id started with uee all of them never past the 10th epi she is too flat boring dull so unatractive for me it will be utterly unbearable for me to watch her for 100 epi or more id been watching kdramas for about 4 years and i watched tons of them and i like all the lead females uee is the only one exception I love the songs but I do not know the title and the singer. Can I have title of the songs and the singers in English. Excellent drama. I\\'m loving this drama and I\\'m really happy that Korea is loving it too, the ratings are greater each episode! Love this drama, been watching it since ep1. Really good development so far. Although a few characters need touch ups, but all is well. The scenes of Daeryuk and Dorean must have been inspired by What’s Wrong With Secretary Kim hehehe I thought I saw Park Ha Na in a blind date scene... Oh my, I Wish she\\'s not only appear as a cameo but the leading actress replacing Uee... Hehehe sorry Uee...:) Ugh! The stepmother and stepsister don\\'t deserve anything good from Do Ran. I am getting so frustrated watching episode 21! Also, that step sister doesn\\'t even deserve meeting DaYa\\'s brother as a love interest! Ugh! if I was writing this, I\\'d write the stepmother and stepsister getting into misfortunes forever and then repenting their misdeeds later on! Ugh! Just Ugh! I like the drama so far. The \"Myyyy Fredddddy\" lady is soo cheesy and cringey Of all the boys I like my curly hair yiryook he is so funny and cut but I don\\'t feel chemistry with his couple da ya I have to see the rest couples but right now I like Do Ran and dearyook 100 eps off Uee? Just happiness! OMG THIS DRAMA IS SOOOO GOOD! It has the best story line ever and i think i will watch all of the 100 eps!!! I am being spoiled my longest drama i will ever watch ❤️❤️❤️ Cant wait to see Doran & Daeryook and soon.. Miran and Gorae ❤️ Hope this drama will become more popular!!! OMG! I love the chemestry between doran and daeryooki cant wait to see the next episode. @Kamp Gumeson 100 eps?! I\\'m American and TV shows can longer than that but Korean does not know how to make long shows. Sooner or later it becomes a stalemate between groups and gets really stale. One example is American soap opera. But maybe it\\'s a daytime Korea soap opera with a end? But I LOVE Uee! And her super long fingers. I recommend to watch this drama it is very kind and lovely i can\\'t wait to watch the next episode Very nice and I think it\\'s getting more better, made me cry already and it\\'s only on tenth episode. Uee is one of the good actress that we really like, gain more weight and never curl that hair again,then everything is going to be great.FIGHTING! can\\'t wait next weekend to watch it again. Uee never fails vieweres with her acting skills! <3 Viewing rate is low but this is my type of drama. Looking forward to new episodes every week... <3 The supporting actors are better than the main. Choi Soo-Jong... whoa! Fighting! You ARE in character (only). LOL You play the role SO well!! I think i would really like this drama. Its an emotionally effected drama whoaaa.... eps 7-8 please Does anyone know the title of the soundtrack? I love it!!! Almost done watching the first. I’m disappointed. There is on element that bothers me. The cruelty toward the baby/child. Why is this necessary? I think it will be offputting for foreign viewers. The storyline was awesome besides. I thought once the wife did the DNA and found out he didn’t cheat she would get better. It doesn’t look like it. This could have been a great story of a dad and daughter reconnecting after prison. The friend caring for the daughter and continuing to contact the friend during and after prison also awesome. Disapppointed. Again. Looks like I get to watch reruns of older dramas for a time. Lee Jang-Woo back yesssssss Bad directing, feels like old cinematography. The drama sounds promising... It\\'s cool and the actors/actresses making the story even better. Hope they keep the story interesting till the end. Fighting! It happens that I haven\\'t any issue with any of the main actors (and that is very rare), on the contrary, I like them. The plot looks promising, in conclusion, I have big hopes with this drama. I loved the first episode the actors were well introduced. Yoon jin yi cute as usual and Uee never disapoints and allways gaining sympathy with he angel face. what i also liked is that the first episode is exactly like the trailer a little bit of drama and then funny sceens to lighten the mood and then agai returning to the tragic story. yoon jinyi ♥♥♥ I am so happy my girl yoon Jin yi is gone be Main lead fighting my beautiful girl So glad to have Lee Jang Woo back since being released from the military!! I can\\'t wait for this one. He\\'s amazing in everything!! I thank goodness for the casting for my golden life. Main lead was excellent. Go YeonTae from Five Children! Omg my favorite actress is back .uee fighting can\\'t wait to see yoon jin yi in her new color I am happy cause my lovely yoon Jin yi is gone act in this drama I hope they the roll she deserves because she act very good I would love for the financial difficulties to stop being a theme. I know a lot of my KDrama friends feel that weekends should be kept for family dramas, not murder mysteries. Another KBS2 weekend drama where a DNA test comes into play, what\\'s this, at least four in a row now? My Father is Strange, My Golden Life, Marry Me Now?...Aigoo! Wait.. didn\\'t uee got offered role for my golden life but she declined? It has \"financial trouble, wrong parents\" story too.. lol. What goes around comes around, I guess? I got the chill from the plot but I will have to wait for almost two months. Really looking forward for this drama. I\\'m excited for Uee\\'s comeback but the writer of this drama is so not my favorite. I watched Blow Breeze last year on TV and that drama was so damn bad and dragging. The best thing about the drama was only the acting especially the veteran actors.

I can’t wait! ID: Gangnam Beauty was so cuteee I hope this one is as well Yep this is gonna get good ratings no doubt about it jisooooooooo!!! Wow popcorn and coke oh ji soo was suddenly back...I have missed u oops Back when I was kid, around 10 or 11 there was a rumor circulating around our school that a homeless guy was living under the bridge near the Senior High School in our place. Being mischievious and all, my friends and I decided to confirm if the rumor was true or not. Shockingly, it was all true. A guy was listerally living under the bridge on a boat. He was harmless and he was even funny. He talked to us after school hours and we found out his family left him and went to live overseas. He didnt want to burden his aging parents because he was suddenly jobless after leaving the city (we're living in a small town). I think he went a little crazy maybe from suddenly losing his job then his wife and kids. He said he could predict our future by reading our palms and we just made him comfortable and showed him our palms. He said so many silly things but he was always kind and warm. After a month, he suddenly vanished and we never saw him again. I'll watch this drama because it reminds me of him, a friend from our childhood. Ji Soo is back but I didn't expect a 2episodes drama\",\n",

       "  'comments': \"am sad that ka soo won nothing in the awards:'( his role was heart-touching Woaahh really love Dr. Moon Seungjae in this drama <3 To all fans who love the medical dramas of Korea, Really love this drama series.. I'm so dissapointed with prof. Choi? why you change like that. Omg...this is my first time watching medical drama without skipping any episode...no love story, no kissing,...which is i really like it because i can watch it with my kids....good drama, good cast, and good production team...?? The best medical drama, can't stop watching till the end. So today this drama Heart Surgeons has come to an end. the best medical drama I watch.. no love story, no melodrama but the unique about this stories make me fall in love is the story line full with surgery and the plot always make me curious each episode. excited waiting the last episode. hope the last episode didn't make me disappointed. really love their relationship between doctor and nurse staff.. recommended One of the medical drama I watch...so far this is really good, doesn't have any boring scene, always make me curious..watch it bcoz of seo ji hye, all the best in the upcoming last episode today This is probably the best medical dramas of all time<3 Is this drama have love story? hehe I ship tae soo and soo yeon so bad xxx This is so heartbreaking drama T.T @claire: it because they try to find another hospital but all reply with full operating rooms or no doctor available (maybe because it's really full or they aware of the diagnose where his mother life percentage even after operation might be 5%. Then he learn about professor cho who agree to give a chance. But after things happened in early episode, he couldnt bring her to other place because of time. Enjoying this kind of Kdrama.. I love this show. I love the whole medical team that always work with Dr Park amd Prof Choi, especially the anaesthetist, perfusionist(I hope to know their names they're really good actors) and nurse. Lee Jae won and Choi Daehoon are great supporting actors too they are so funny and lift the spirit, I can't help but to laugh after I almost cry in many scenes. Also, the script and medical scenes look pretty real, it gives me an insight of what surgeons and physicians do. Overall, great cast and production, it's so refreshing to watch a drama that focuses on the profession and not romance. I'm looking forward to see what happen after Dr Park runs away with the heart. i think this about bromance..... but no huhuhu i ship goso & umh ki joon hahaha... disappointed Episode 13-14 i love these kind of drama at first i thought it's like romantic doctor teacher kim seeing ko soo's mother needs operation but no one is willing to Lapping this up and what a whirlwind start! Gosh Go Soo and Uhm Ki Joon have cemented their characters right from the get go of Episode 1. However it was rather a patient wait for our Seo Ji Hye to appear....I’m going to sit back and make no judgement calls on this because I want to be either pleasantly surprised or extremely annoyed. I’m hoping for the former. Watching HS for Kim Ye Won really but kinda confused as to why she has been relegated to supporting cast with no photo pix here when she was part of the press release and other promotions with the main leads? Fingers crossed that there is at least some kind of romance between GS and SJH - please? I don't understand: why doesn't he take his mother to another hospital if no doctor will operate on her? Is there only one hospital in the country? Or he would rather his mom die than transfer her to another hospital? Uhm Ki-Joon, he was very good at Defendant, so excited to see him again how he will be------ kinda curious how they persuade Go Soo to make a comeback. with this drama. Well, welcome back Go Soo! In Uhm Ki-Joon I trust. why Ji Sung oppa not taking this series? T.T (Uhm Ki Joon) He matched the evil role, ( Seo Ji Hye) her face looked poisonous This looks promising so worth a shot. Oh yeah finally Seo Ji hye as a female lead, I really love her acting in Black knight, she is the best villain ever. I can’t wait to watch this drama I will wait for her drama ❤️ She so cute and I love her?? So excited for this! Uhm Ki Joon's comeback drama and it's with the award-winning Defendant team! Daebak! I really liked Defendant.. so I think I will enjoy this one too. HAN HYO JOO & KO SOO perfect couple, they both working in movie LOVE 911/ Bandage 911, and they both great acting great..please PDnim Han Hyo Joo please..... Yoo In Na please Soo young snsd please Han hyo joo please I hope this drama would be as good as Defendant!! Looking forward to this drama ✨ ko soo oppa!! kyaaa~ can't wait Hope to see a drama come back of either Kim Tae-hee after child birth. If not, Lee Min-jung, Han Chae-young, Im Soo-jung any of them should be great with this role.\",\n",

       "  'comments': 'Have been marathoning dramas of so ji seob, well actually, watched just one before this hihihi but my love for ji seob led me here and i am so delighted. Haha. This drama gave me a ton of laugh which i really love!! Have a smile on my face after finishing it. The crying moments made me cry as well. I love the actors and actresses! Aw. I HOPE MBC MAKE SEASON 2 let\\'s go aerinbon flourishing couple life haha [spoiler alert here^^]i really want to see them even just hold hands or yes do the nose to nose again which was so cool and sweet too yayy while confirming their feelings for each other- maybe in the next season? Hihi (im really a sucker for romance) haha thank you terius behind me! ❤ Hello! Who know the background music from ep 15 (or ep 30), 42:30? I can\\'t find it with shazam. If everyone know this song, tell me please. Thank you.:) I finished this drama in just 2 days. I just loved this drama excellent cast,story everything.. highly recommended ❤❤❤ Excellent. It was well written, well acted, and a lot of fun to watch. Wow! Bravo team Secret Terius!!! Just finish watching all episodes, and yes as others said this drama is like all in one package. There is pack of action, mystery, thriller, and moreover comedy in it. The ending also unbelievable, I couldn\\'t predict that at all but still can\\'t complain since it\\'s a happy ending. If there is Season 2 of this drama? YES YES YES!!! Loved this show. Season 2 please. The actors and actresss, adult or children were enchanting. Two thumbs up. Best drama from MBC. Believe That!!!! I love this drama everything in one action romance comedy family suspense it was just mind blowing and fun watching it I watch this series on a legal streaming site and now considering dropping this poorly written drama. This drama really hurts my logic. It began smoothly and then it\\'s getting more and more implausible. I can tolerate plot holes and flaws to some points and this drama has crossed the line. Sad, because actually I like the cast. Korean children are the best and most natural actors in the world, but the 2 children in this drama unfortunately met this writer. She created a nightmare of permissive child-rearing, where kids throw screaming tantrums on the floor in the supermarket, order their parents around like Joseon-era slaves, and do the exact opposite of everything they are told to do, including invading and stealing other people\\'s property, putting their hands on the cakes in a bakery, and waltzing off with complete strangers. One wonders what they would do if they were told not to play in the traffic. I don\\'t know why So Ji-Sub took this role, as he looks like a guy that would know how to invest wisely, and not be forced to do this demeaning script. They filmed several shots in Warsaw. Season 2 please I really loved this drama. Everything was perfect. I hope I\\'ll find something as good as Terius behind me to watch. Everything in this drama except the writing is good. Cast is great... director does a good job with building suspense but the writing is soooooo amateur. I mean just ridiculous. Plot holes, characters with contradicting traits, just annoying. I enjoyed the kids and KIS the most everything else was just annoying to watch. Skipped though all of it. Best drama ever, prefer the spy side of the story compared to the babysitting side though I love this drama! Keep me on my toes and wanting to keep watching till the end. I hope for a sequel too! Sequel pleaseeeeeee, i need season 2 when bon and aerin doing a mission at NY What is up with Im Se Mi and that Park Bo Gum haircut?!!!! I haven\\'t been so addicted to a show since Oh My Venus!! It has everything!! The comedy and seriousness was such an excellent blend! I can\\'t wait to buy this and add this to my collection! We\\'re in need of so much more!! Thank you to all the writers, actors, production team--just everyone that was a part of this drama!! Best kdrama of the year! It has everything in it: comedy,thriller,action,romance. Great pacing from start till end. Would look forward to the writer\\'s next show~ 7 awards in 1 event!! They deserved it!! Congratss!! Its the best korean drama I\\'ve ever seen ...why they don\\'t have a kiss scene? ...I\\'m always hoping for the season 2 with the kiss of course... This movie deserves an award pls.Very fantastic movie,am so impressed and I most say the lead actress is very good and reminds me of Lee No You g with her acting and facial expression.The lead actor the lead actress and the female boss,in fact they all deserve an award.. Awesome...So JiSub was amazing as always...storyline was good...all characters are well played... This Drama Is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Worth watching! Too much flaws just started this drama and im very surprised this is as good as it can be cuz the other dramas im watching are just so so this is the first time im seeing the lead female and getting a great impression her acting is superb i dont understand why she was the 3rd choice i doubt the first 2 choices can act better than her the story line is great and so entertaining im already hooked waiting impatiently for the next epi i think i completely fell for the lead female love the story, new plot, mixed with comedy, mind bugging next scene, great cast of characters. I loveee this drama!! Every episode literally kept me on my toes. All the characters were so endearing from the KIS team, to Ra Do Woo & Yoo Ji Yeon, Kim Bon & Go Ae Rin. I think my favorite character was Jin Yong Tae though, he was hilarious as Ae Rin’s boss and I loved the bromance between him and So Ji Sub. All the characters were so well played and had great chemistry. Definitely worth watching again! really love this drama:D Awesome drama! Interesting plot and the casting are awesome, highly recommended! I watched every drama of So Ji Sub, he\\'s such a great actor and so handsome as well. So Ji Sub and Jung In-sun have a good chemistry that made every episode exciting and always has something to look forward into. It could have been better if they fell in love for each other in the end of the drama, although i still love how the writer ended it. It was another superb drama and highly recommended. It was a good thing that Jung In-sun got the lead actress role instead of Lee Yoo Young, because the latter actress has a very limited facial expression, not so charming and boring. Love the drama, its a balance of romance,comedy and a bit of mystery. I thought that the female chief is the spy of the \"the voice\" they are talking about. I never thought they trusted the wrong guy, I like how So Ji Sub play as the babysitter for the two kids. I also like the story, hope they have part 2 I loved it and enjoyed watching it in every minute, Highly recommended. love this!!! Highly recommended...hats off. Oppah So Ji-sub, so handsome. Good story,,good act,,spec .Sojisub kim bon,,airien,,and the twins..love Vote for season -2!!! love to watch this series.. A must watch drama! The genre is perfectly balanced with the action, a bit of romance and even comedy!! Plus the perfect cast! I love this drama! Im a sucker of romantic drama thus usually it doesn\\'t appeal to me dramas that has no or slight romance. So as i read various comments that this only had slight romance i hesitated to watch it.. But so ji sub is my very first korean actor i fell in love with ( something happened in bali) so i took time to watch this and voila!!!! I absolutely like this drama. Everything was done perfectly... It has romantic side of its own which made this unique coz even though no skinship you could feel the sweetness in their actions towards each other... And the humor of this.. It\\'s really great. And you will fall how terius take good care of the kids.. So adorable... Overall a great action, comedy and yes for me it\\'s romantic drama. Hoping for season 2... Omg the moment careless whispers being played it just to hot and funny xD. vote for season 2 same cast!! Whoop whoop!! Love it. Love how the drama integrate the sense of community into its storyline. Everything was great till the end and the balanced plotline also great. The twist of the real villain also great, however I don\\'t know why but I already knew it since the actor who plays the real villain also potrays that kind of character in another drama. So not really a twist in there. Really need more convincing act in this plotline. However, don\\'t worry the story itself is amazing! Wahhh this is one of the nice kdrama i watch so far.. even tho i wait to happen in some episode that the lead actor en actress have some kissing scene hehhehe.. even tho that not happen am still kinikilig to the both of theme specially when kim bon do the nose to nose to go ae rin??. Ahh and also i like the thamdem of yoo ji yeon en ra do woo hope one day they have a drama together as couple someday hehe☺.. and lastly hope this kdrma have part 2!! Plsss i want to know what will happen to kim bon en go ae rin as they pretend lovers in the end of drma.! Vote for Part 2: Mr & Mrs Terius. The spy side of the story? Boring. saranghae oppa so ji-sub!!! The best! I need Part 2 please.... The besttttttt!!!!! Everything\\'s perfect. The writer and director really did their very best. And Jung In Sun, I love youuuuuuuuu. Hope to see you on another dramas. I love your role simce from Waikiki and here. woooooooooooow it\\'s just amazing! i wish it never ends:\\'(:\\'( whyyyyy finally rating crosses 20% . love this drama ,love so ji sub Sad to see it end, this was a great drama. I\\'m glad the first two Female leads declined the lead role because Jung In-Sun was a perfect fit for this character. So Ji-sub what can you say about him that hasn\\'t already been said one of my favorite actors. The whole cast and crew did a great job on this one, I\\'ve watched a lot of Korean dramas and this one is in my top ten. It would be nice to see a season two, but I don\\'t have the same feeling about it as the rest. I truly think the director Kwon Young-Sil (Seo Yi-Sook) is just playing match maker for the two, they both had feelings for each other they just needed a push in the right direction. No romance till the end, so far I like the story and all characters, but really want to see terius n alice with body contact, not only nose kisses??? pleaseeeee just completed this drama and i must say that this was a really good and entertaining one! so ji sub was amazing as always... jung in sun portrayed her character really well.. joon-joon were the most adorable kids i have ever seen on screen and they acted soo well... the nose-nose thingy was soo cute! especially when so ji sub does it to jung in sun!! for the first time i wasn\\'t bothered by the fact that there was no romance in this drama.. their friendship is a ship that will forever sail! the KIS was amazing too... the storyline kept me hooked from the beginning to the end! son ho jun was another remarkable character... the guy who played ra do woo is so handsome! the OST\\'s were pretty good too... and that was a really good way to end a drama... i really wish we could have got an insight on the mission that was given to them in the end! Omg I love love loved this drama! It would be great if a season 2 were to be made starting there trip in NY! Hopefully they will consider it ❤️ Season 2 with full of romance please! Alice and Terius❤️ Definitely my top 3 best drama this year! Love the actors<3 i need season 2 for this drama.. Does anyone know the name of the actor that played Kwon Young Shil’s bodyguard? Love the ending! One of the best drama in my list! Really really like the characters, story line and plot twist. Hope there will be season 2, Terius & Alice, pleaaaasee.... Hope to see So Ji-Sub and Jung In-Sun in season 2 ❤️ It\\'s good drama with no cheesy romance but make viewer want more romance in it, an action drama with no so much action in it. And the best is KIS. Really like the twist on this drama , Goodwork Writers? Season 2 please?? Season 2: Mr and Mrs Terius???. Oh my god best drama ever!!! Im gonna miss this drama.. So ji sob oppa and jing yong tae and the twins...all of them im gonna miss them!!!! Hopefully for season 2......!!!!! Thank you for your hard work to mbc, all cast and staff...⚘⚘ Happy ending is not only having leads ending up with each other, so I hope they wouldn’t force a love line between two leads. I honestly don’t see the need for them to fall for each other. at first, I like Go Ae Ra\\'s role but after eps 13 she kinda disturbing, messed things up and lots of curiosity about bon and his work. >,< Am thinking kwon will be the one to save Terius tomorrow I hope there is no romance between the two main lead that\\'s a huge age gap going on there . Like ewwww Favorite part is when Bon plays with Joon-Joon❤️ Towards the final week!!! I\\'m curious how this drama will end.. can\\'t wait. But at the same time feel sad... What is the brand of hair product that Ae Rin used? Is the hair styling wax stick. Which site can I purchase online? @Sella That\\'s the main point of this drama. Terius Behind Me from the title itself. Does it make sense to you? Anyway, I love this drama. @Yacinta Thank you soooo much <3 All the cast play very well! I guess the scriptwriter is wise enough not to put too much romantic scene between Kim Bon and Ae Rin because she just lost her husband. But I really love how Bon becomes honest with his feeling! This drama will be so mainstream and dull if there is no Ae Rin, Joon-Joon, and KIS team. I can\\'t wait for the next episodes but not ready for the ending. Hope they will get the award for the Best Cast!! @Pan Yang Da Il- Eonjejjeum boilkka - OST Terrius Behind Me part 5 I just wish they don\\'t force on the coupling of the two leads. Imagine the woman just lost her husband, it was only few months since that happened and she haven\\'t had the proper time to grieve then here appears a man showing a bit of interest on her. It will appear she is easy and didn\\'t really love her deceased husband. Maybe they can time jump to few years in the future if they really want to push them together having a happy ending, that would be more acceptable. @bggazz now i\\'m listening to all his song:) his voice so similar. Thank you. <3 Ps. when you find that song please do not forget to tell me. Thank you... I\\'ll watch it when it is finished dont want to wait for each episode?.I love jung in sun and so ji sub definately gonna watch this drama.Just wateched welcome to waikiki of jung in sun and i really loved here character damn im her fan good to know that she is a main lead in it too?She is getting lead roles and with so ji sub wow?. This drama would be so much nicer without Go Ae Rin and the kids. They really messed up the scene, so annoying. They should be minor character who caused all these but not along with main character. Thanks to So Ji Sub for saving this drama. @Pan I love this show but I love anything So Ji Sub is in. he\\'s always a great action actor and was funny in Maters\\'s Sun but this is a whole new level of sweet. i\\'m do glad i get the opportunity to watch in the US Writer and director please don\\'t kill Galaxy shim.the movie will never be the same without her While I loveee So Ji-Sub, I cant seem to want to watch till the end because of Jung In-Sun. I just can\\'t feel the connection between the 2 of them. Do you know the song from ep 23, 5:30. I can\\'t find it on youtube. If you guys know this song, tell me please. Thank you. <3 @Lea @edison I totally agree with you that Shim Woo Cheol is mole. The guy is suspicious! So Ji Sub ❤❤❤❤ Worth it to watch .? Your still amazing So Ji Sub .❤️ good story line with good actors in their character roles --- Shim woo cheol is the mole in NIS There’s a song from ep 8 in the background when Bon and Ae Rin are together at the cafe after her disastrous driving lesson, if anyone could find out or tell me the name of that song I would really appreciate it!!! An ex-NIS agent and a housewife combo-what an ingenious story! And casting So Ji Sub is a brilliant move. I say the role Kim Bon is made especially for So Ji Sub. Jung In Sun is also doing an excellent job in portraying a smart and loving mother. I am enjoying every episode- good pacing, great twists and intriguing plot. Hopefully, they will wrap up the ending well. So far so good! Great drama... SJS , actress & kids??? Ji sub have a kite from these twin??? I think candy Is alive... Just WOW.. I love this drama. The kids are so cute. but i\\'m waiting week by week it\\'s a torture huhuhu. I\\'m in love with kim bon, ae rin, joon-joon, KIS gang, ji yeon, do woo... they\\'re so funny and cute and sweet... and the other cast member suits with their role perfectly that i\\'m impressed.. i can\\'t wait for the next episode... ❤ terius behind me from malaysia I\\'m holding my breath it\\'s such an intersting Drama. I\\'s so blessed to see SJS he\\'s just amazing and the clever mother role was made for JIS. Watching the couple SJS / JIS i\\'ve got some memories of the cute couple of Mystery Queen,the manly protective guy andan ajuma as detective it\\'s way too powerful... not to mentione the amazing skills of acting from all the actors especially the Kid\\'s they are too cute. I\\'m really amazed, watching this drama made my day. just wow. this drama is so damn good I just love this drama....everything in this drama is so beautiful.... I\\'m happy that so ji sub choose this drama as comeback project. he is so handsome..i m in love with him...best storyline and best so ji sub..oppa fighting It’s the dramas that you go in least expecting anything only to be pleasantly surprised and instantly hooked and TBM is one if them. Drawn to this because it’s the Adonis himself -So Ji Sub but I’m eating humble pie because Jung In Sun is the perfect choice as Ae Rin and the storyline has all the elements of a good action/thriller combo. Sorry but Yoo In Na and Lee Yoo Young were right to decline because JIS has the more of a maternal vibe and comedic approach to the role. Those 2 kids though......cute but are absolute terrors! Binge watching now to catch up. Very happy as to how this is going. DAMN! I should know I have to watch this drama when it ends already. waiting week by week is such a torture! This drama is lovable... especially too much handsome oppa in one frame haha.. but there something bothering me, both J boss and the hacker remind me to Roy Kiyoshi (indonesian entertainer/magician/whatever) who recently do plastic surgery.. maybe he inspired by those guy? Omoo, cant wait for next episode annnd suspect sangryeol wife is high priest??? Falling In Love with Kim Bon.Serious but loving with Ae Rin child. I started this drama because I was bored, I had no expectations. but man this drama is realy interesting, I love watching su ji sub with kids, and I love how story is going. I realy recommend this drama because its fun and have a good storyline too. @saintkkura (my twitter)Hi, i am a guy, kdrama addicts, hereby, asking all of you that read this comments, please go on and watch this drama. no worry, its already episode 8, you guys wont have to be so painful to wait for next episode, because I almost quit this drama because of all the unrealistic (amateurish?) secret agent/spy scenes but the comedic parts are entertaining enough to keep me watching for now. (particularly that scene where that lady was about to get shot in the back by a sniper and he just yells \"nooooo!\" instead of pulling out his gun.You would think with all the precautions they were taking for her safety she would be wearing a bulletproof vest!) and I thought the lead Jung In-Sun was Yoon Se-Ah at first. (especially when she smiles) Waaaahh!!.this soo amazing kind of drama..The chemistry of them makes me sooo kiiiillllliggggg???.The twins soo cute and adorable?.The female lead is so amazing and good in spying..Hahahahaha..i think she\\'s kind of a good observer thats why she found out the secret room where Ra do Woo,Kim Bon and Yoo ji-yeon stay..and the last is the antogonist i dont know if he is trying to be a bad person cause everytime they see each other his scared to be hit by the male Lead...Terius Behind Me is so perfectly perfect in love, action and comedy????????? Entertaining drama Kingscastle Information System rocks!!! Jeez!! Imagine having two little runts like those twins in real life. What a nightmare!!! This drama is amazing. So ji sub is really good actor. This drama so fun. Specially the boss:)) The Drama is really amazing . I was willing to watch the show solely because of So Ji sub but i loved the concept of the show as i watched..its a good show blend of humour,cuteness, suspense, action and everything one can ask for.. Every character has its own charm. The relation build up between each character is amazing. The acting is also on point. I dont agree with people complaining about Jung in sun acting, i rather appreciate her acting skill cause shes too young to play a mom fir too but she pulled tge Job very well. Love tge caste altogether from So ji sub to jung in sun, her cute twins,the KSI group and even our antogonist Son ho joon lol This drama is incredibly good! I absolutely love so ji sub and the kids. This world is so f up. It’s indubitable that SJS is hot. We all know that he is hunky and good looking. We cannot deny his screen presence. He has star quality, and we enjoy looking at his face, his physique, his charm in the show. Yes, he is a star. Excuse me Terius in the manga was so overrated he left Candy for Susana Marlowe. What’s with this neverending Terius obsession after all these passing years? This is the first time I ship the female lead and our cute villain!:D also Im Se-Mi and so ji sub looks good together. I love the parents gang the most. They are hillarious and always come up with crazy ideas.:-D:-D:-D My fave drama so far! Iloveu So Ji Sub.. The chemistry is between Go Ae rin & her boss <3 and So Ji Sub and In Se Mi:D Good drama, the bad guy CEO Jin i can\\'t hate u. Too cute to be a bad guy I am so in love with this drama. I am so crazy for waiting every week for this drama. So ji sub for life?? Don\\'t get me wrong, I love the actress and go ae rin character itself. I\\'ve seen many of her performances and she\\'s good. But I still thinks so ji sub is too hot for her or just maybe i\\'m being judgmental because sjs is on a whole another level when it come to all of his job. Gonna crazy waiting for the next episod..?? @Kris yes, you are the only one thinking of that. Because the actress is just doing her job, and you are affected by the personality of her character in the drama not actually her acting. You probably can\\'t accept that fact and just blame it into her acting. Believe me, everything is scripted and that makes you all emotional. Please act and judge professionally without much subjectivity. Am i the only one who find the acting of female lead a bit over-the-top Basically So Ji Sub is the only reason that keeps me watching this drama. Another roles in this drama is seriously not fun to watch. The female lead is a turn off, her character also doesn\\'t add any fun for this drama:/ Hello, anybody knows what the title of the song that was played on the LP? Go ae rin curiosity is so surreal and annoying @wht , EXACTLY! Ive been thinking the same thing! And i was hoping he stops being the bad guy T_T! Id love to see him getting jealous over Ae Rin ah lol.. Dear SJS, The main female lead is annoying poking her nose everywhere why son ho jun soo handsome in this drama??? loovee it I liked the first 4 episodes....i really appreciate the crew n actors for this n hope that i ll never b disappoint......su ji sub oppa....u r cute....n fit as always....u r fan fron overseas(india)....sarangey oppa So excited to watch this drama...I’m a fan of this hunky man So Ji Sub, even do he is a serious type of man, but he acts perfectly in comedy drama, like “Oh my Venus”... The two forst episodes was absoluttly amazing and fun to watch. Looking forward to the next episodes? I love it. looking forward for the next episodes ????????????????looking forward for the next episode,SU JI SUB,??? I didnt expect this drama to be this fun and I\\'m liking what i\\'ve got so far. The amount of serious & silly moment is really good too (scene where the neighbors try to stop the kidnapper is really cool). I just hope that this drama didnt lost its focus and dont end up to be milking the romance between the lead, like other drama. Wow lead guy unique role in this drama.some dramas feel like it should never end.that\\'s the feelings i\\'m getting now. eventhough i prefer su ji sub with lee yeon hee (in ghost) and that i hope they will work again in a another drama! i still enjoy this drama the 2 first ep didn\\'t disappoint me at all! su ji sub is just perfect in all the roles he plays in! with jung in sun they form a pretty well pair! Oh my. This drama is so good that kept me hooked and intrigued. I am looking forward for the next episodes, the scriptwriter is so impressive knowing that she wrote my one of the most favorite Korean Drama, Shopping King Louie. As much as I love So Ji Sub with all my heart and being; I’m trying so hard to be mature about the female lead so much so it’s giving me a headache. So Son Ho Jun’s casting might just be the catalyst to push me into watching the first episode and so with gritted teeth and extreme will power; I’m going in. Roger that! ??????????from Egypt I love all u r drama u my favorite actor Ji–sub be strong for ever u r fan Dr. Heba why i got a feel like the lead actress will also be some kind of agent and is related to so ji sub ex girlfriend i.e cindy ....well we will get to know at the end... I am so watching this... oppa fighting!!! Glad to see you back in drama again! So Ji Sub plus In Sun plus two Kids ..it\\'s gonna be a blast????this premiers today.can\\'t wait.... Im Se-Mi looks great with short hair!!!! So ji sub in this drama so l am in it without any discussion so ji sub was in Poland and i missed it! nooo...

       "  'comments': 'I love the cast ..All of them were really amazing! Bad drama. Only effeminate man like Joon-Young will fool a decent girl like Se-Eun, someone who says one thing and acts differently. And the writers must be feminist that is why they promote the saying the a \"playboy makes a better husband than a decent man who will always love their first love\", this is absolute trash talk, this will only mind conditioned women to gravitate to such types of men and lead their life into turmoil. Women like Young-Jae will never be completely happy it\\'s their karma since they always violate the ethics of relationship, they are always on the lookout for a better man, such that they will move from one man to another, always not satisfied. Men like Ho-Chul will always be in a prey on woman in a relationship since he ravish even woman despite knowing that he can not be a better man, he cannot wait for his turn, his motto is to win and to prove himself. I really like this show so far, although, I really hope that the writers surprise me and not to do the usual long time friends turning into lovers. this series made me come back to reading. i love how the writer gave a character like kang dan yi. im so inspired by her. i hope dan yi gets recognized, and i hope she gets the love she deserves. she is a gem. It\\'s not good for ordinary people, but it\\'s kinda good for those who want a very complicated sad not-acceptable hard-to-forget story. This kind of feeling, is the third charm of drama. I\\'m having a doubt if I ahould watch this or not. I\\'m a new fan of Seo Kang Joon and I want to watch all of his tv series, but. . but I\\'m sick of love stories or stories that revolves around romantic relationships. I watched 1/4 of the first ep but I immediately got boring. And I dont mean to be rude or what but E Som looks too old for Kang Joon. I cant stand it. Hayss A very good drama. But make sure only watch it if you have a steel heart. Kudos to all actors! -EDIT- Wow I am still overwhelmed by this drama from beginning till the last episode. Seriously my thought was mindblown of how great they portrayed the reality of the relationships that is so realistic its amazing. Even though some may not like the ending very well,, I think that the writer is a very open person being able to understand such hardships and they chose these amazing actors with such chemistry its astonishing!! This is a drama that really warms the heart of the people who has gone through such situations in their lifes too. This drama is a charm itself. so good, im watch 12 eps only 2days in website, oh my god i wish the third charm can be the best korean drama in 2018, and i like on joon yound; lee young jae; and min se eun.so lovee <3 Omg this drama really hits me? I was swayed with On Joon-young, Lee Young-jae, Lee Dong-jae and the rest of the cast acting and also the OST.?It really shows the reality of lifes relationship, it is not just more on happiness but sometimes life is composed of hardships. Watching this drama made me laugh, in love and cried a lot??? kudos to the writer of the story even if I wanted the main character to have a happy ending (they got married 2 yrs. After in New York)???but then again I really love this drama so much!?More power and God bless? I love this drama. Good job for seo kang joon and esom, they are so cute and unpredictable. For me, love story has many way and this drama have a good ending for hard story love. Pass. I love KSJ but this drama just ran in circles. He misunderstands. She misunderstands. They literally got together and broke up again in every episode.Then it progresses and they focus on themselves (god finally), just for YJ to call back to him crying. It\\'s infuriating to see how selfish and dumb they both are. Its obvious that YJ had a rough time but it was her decision to move on with HC so how is it that she still relies on JY when she knows he\\'s moving on?? Same way around, my guy JY has been in a 4 year relationship and with just one call, he\\'s able to flip it upside down? Yikes. That hard cut on SE\\'s after story was also terrible. I wish we got an end to her side rather than just a cry. The ending wasn\\'t terrible, because I understand why SE would end the relationship and why JY and YJ didn\\'t get back together (thank god) but like damn is JY dumb for coming back around... i knew it... i knew it..... this drama will be a troublesome, i can\\'t forget it, and it\\'s not a good thing, with this ending. i can\\'t tell it\\'s good, nor can\\'t tell it\\'s bad. It\\'s not good for ordinary people, but it\\'s kinda good for those who want a very complicated sad not-acceptable hard-to-forget story. This kind of feeling, is the third charm of drama. I don\\'t get the hate about the drama\\'s ending. For me, it was perfect, it was realistic. I love how they left the ending open for viewers\\' interpretation. I still think they love each other in the end though, but it was maturity that stopped them from moving on to another romantic relationship. Before they have to love others, they had to love and find their selves first, only then will they be ready to give and accept love. Who knows, they might cross paths again for the 4th time and maybe by that time, their relationship will work. Kudos to the whole team for making a wonderful drama. I will definitely have a hard time getting over this. I don\\'t know why other people are disappointed, but for me, the ending was great. It was realistic to say at least. I love how the ending was left open for viewers\\' interpretation. Well, for me, I thought they still love each other, but they can\\'t love each other yet for they have to love their selves first. It was very mature for both of them to choose not to force another romantic relationship. Who knows, they might have another encounter in the unknown future again, and maybe that time, when both of them are ready enough, their relationship will work. Kudos to the whole team for making a wonderful drama, and to the artists for doing such great jobs. Another drama I will never forget. Se eun pop up to sudden and they didn’t show much relationship between her and joon young. I didnt see fond in their relationships. And they(the production team) simply kill her role as we expected. Anyway, one thing to be sure, guy never settle for their first love. If they never settle shouldn’t they be more care during their first love and make things work out. If they cant, then they should move on. Dont let the future chained with the past and you keep dragging the past while moving on to the future. Lets be considerate to others and be more humane. Really so sad draka for me . I can feel how they hurt .they try . they love each othef .. Seo Kang Joon acting r really great .he cry i\\'m . He laugh i \\'m laugh . .he smile i\\'m smile . Cause i can feel his feelings ? .however .u think . This drama is very meaningful for me . . Lee Young Jae character also broke to my heart? Just want to say I loved this drama it was so amazing, from cinematography, ost and to well written script on a deeper level of thoughts and conversations. It captured the reality on issues of life and relationship. Those who experienced hardships at some point in their lives and relationship would definitely appreciate this drama. In addition casts are amazing as well especially seo, I really admire his versatility in acting, even without saying anything the actions and expressions tells everything. He always give justice to every role he portray. Overall this drama is highly recommended. Just want to say I loved the third charm drama it was so amazing, from cinematography, the ost to well written script on a deeper level of thoughts and conversations. It captured the reality on issues of life and relationship. Those who experienced challenges at some point in their lives especially in relationship can definitely appreciate this drama. Casts were amazing especially Seo, I really admire his versatility in acting, even without saying anything the actions and expressions tells everything. Looking forward to your future projects. Overall this drama is highly recommended. i hate lee young jae\\'s character,, she makes a whole trauble in on jung young\\'s life I must say, I hate sad story. . I always look for drama with happy ending (The world is full of sadness already.?) that\\'s why I always read comments or watch thriller of ending episodes before I watch the other half of the drama. . But for the first time, I was hurt but continue to watch this because this is truly a great story. I will recommend this to anyone that is looking for great drama. SPOILER: this is really sad ending. Not good for those in heartbroken state. For the first time I hate the male lead. The writers make him looks so selfish. I feel really sorry for Se eun . Why don\\'t you just live your life for the future not for the past.? 4 years is not the short time for relationship A 16 episode makjang weekend type drama. What can go wrong? Answer: almost everything. They should have turned this into a full 50 episode full makjang. Waste of Time x2000000000000 I just want to say it out loud, God, Finally, Seo Kang Joon has good drama under his resume. Finally, there is another a good and solid production who are not see him only as a mere eye candy and rely only on his looks. He has been trapped in eye candy / fancy roles for years, and unable him to expand his range more. Well played, show, well played. I should believe in you writers. After all, this is a writers who is responsible to penned a brilliant short melodrama Like A Fairy tale. The story is very sad, but somehow I don\\'t cry. Not like other dramas with mediocre stories, but very touching until I shed tears. This drama is very sad but it pisses me off. I feel so sorry about SE, she’s so sincerely loves JY. But, there’s no love in JY’s eyes for SE. And thats makes me upset. I\\'m upset because YJ is so selfish. I\\'m upset because JY is so stupid. I\\'m upset because none of the couples in this drama are going well. I mean, why do they have to make everything so complicated? I decided to watch this drama because I thought it would be a fresh drama with an adorable love story. But now I feel cheated. SPOILERS I loved the drama. First half was entertaining and later half gave heartache and seemed real drama. No one gets their first love. Well written and loved it. Loved Esom and Soo Kang Joo. Charm = Omg reading all these comments makes me doubt of watching the last episode. I mean i\\'ve been soo heartbroken since ep12 , but kept on watching despite all that, hoping that my heart would feel at ease at the end, but i think i made the wrong decision of giving myself some hope? irdk now if i\\'m going to watch the last episode? Don\\'t wanna see them part in the end. Huhuhuhu For me in reality compromise and understanding are the most important in married life. Love come in second and love also can fade away. JY and YJ are both very selfish. Need to avoid this kind of person. I had love-hate relationship with this drama,but this drama is beautifully written and executed .will watch it again .thankew. SPOILERS: So the ending is role reversals all around. YJ wanted a glamorous life and ends up liking a simple life. JY wanted the island life but is now headed to cosmopolitan New York. Searching for happiness and not getting it twice. I guess the finale is the Third Charm because they both found a satisfying \"friendship\" end. SE was the nice girl who got dumped. Perhaps JY learned how to be cold from YJ. JY\\'s sister took the dominant role and her significant other was the irritatingly needy one. Feminism takes a stronger role in K-dramas. About time. Waste of time Can this drama get even sadder than this?. This has been nothing but heart ache most of this drama. I had no clue it was going to be like this. I am not one to choose a drama that\\'s going to make my cry all the time.. Her life is a total wreck that she shares with no one.. I\\'m on ep. 13 and I don\\'t see it getting any better, and I don\\'t see our main couple getting back together either. I\\'m stopping now and saving 3 hours of gloom and tears. I have to say that Seo Kang-Joon did an excellent job and should be very proud of his acting. I just couldn\\'t stand the sadness any longer. Esom did a great job also. The whole cast was great I have to access this web to see others comment about last episode of film SPOILERS! That drama really make me to feel like heartbroken. I think after they broke up two times, they will date again because drama\\'s name is third charm.But till the end it fulls of unbelievable things.I can\\'t realize about their love.The one thing that I know exactly is I\\'m really sad after it ends. Loved this drama.The actors made you feel their pain and the story was just like real life with its ups and downs.Excellet. OMG!! i hate young jae. She so selfish. Se eun should got jung young!!. Oh im hate pd nim too To summarize this pile of nonsense: boy meets girl , they get along well enough to like each other , due to her inferiority complex , girl insults the boy after reaching out to her out of concern (she could have said , now i have other things to think about other than dating , brother got into accident , need to take care of him , etc, but no she bluntly said get away from me you wimpy clingy thing). Second meeting boy is enraged about how he was treated but get passed that and date the girl again , the scenes wore lovey dovey until a douche bag enters the scene,She changes from oh a i love you to i\\'m not sure , the future is no clear , the guy perusing me has nothing to do with this situation , ooh poor sad me , what to do , oh well , i break up with you , go find someone else who can make you happy because sure as hell i\\'m not. The boy shocked goes on an unnecessary so called soul searching , meanwhile the girl marries the douche bag , has a child , lived happy until a she lost her child , her life lost meaning so is her marriage , i guess her future was to have a child not a married life.The boy gets a gift of live in form of a lovely girl who loves him and will cherish every gesture he would have made , he seems into her and even proposed , which is known to be promise and we know that that man can\\'t take such action lightly, the boy has moved on. Oh wait let\\'s ruin that , for no apparent reason the boy meets the girl again , and again , i guess misery loves company, and what you know the boy became the douchebagest of them all , breaks the engagement because he saw the girl suffer over her dead child which she had been doing for a long time out his sight, for what: to be with the girl who did the same thing to him in the hope she might let him in (sad face). OMG!!!!! It\\'s over and I was tearing by the last minute of the finale. Okay, I ought to admit that I\\'m little sad how it all ended for SE but I think that she\\'ll have her time and take things back to normal because her persona is so similar to JY. Well, I must say, I am disappointed with the ending...I shouldn`t have started to watch it.:( hate to see YJ appear. this is not fair to SE. YJ was very heartless, he was not entitled to a second chance. while SE always sincerely loves and accompanies JY. SE and JY must be together. This drama is the worst drama I\\'ve ever seen Hate this drama, stopped watching it since eps 13. The lead actor character was so indecisive. Still don\\'t get it why YJ marry that Doctor, and JY still likes her in the end. Really hope JY and SE happy ending, they have right to be happy together. My heart feels soo heavy since ep12. Please let this drama have a happy ending? So, based on the last episode\\'s preview, JY can end up with SE. But the drama is called The Third Charm.. What is going on?! What a waste of time , this writer and director are kind of restarted , the serie had a good premise , but midway , they completely lost it with cliches and unnecessary dramatization , thinking that adding sad dreamy music to scenes will solve the conflicts within the story line ( that went all over the place) and make it seem like some dramatic/romantic sh*t is going on. I hope JY ends up with SE, no matter what SE already waited him for almost 5 years. SE even chase him until Lisbon. I parked this one after ep 8 cause i had a feeling this will lead to something very heart breaking and i was right after watching ep14 but still waiting for the last 2 eps.. i wish every character in this series happiness i mean this could have happened in real life and humans are humans you live your life with every choices you make if JY still chose YJ in the end thats his choice. Everyone has its own selfishness to be happy which is so unfair if you think about it cause for sure someone will get hurt.. but still thats life you always dont know what will happen you may have a plan like JY but when it comes to his heart he always let it win and yeah again humans are humans.. There is a plot twist here, the baby girl is not the daughter of the doctor. I think she got pregnant when JY and YJ broke up and followed him in Lisbon and the rest will leave it to my imagination. This is just my analysis there’s more to this than meets the eye. Let\\'s see where this ends. Was wondering what the writer was thinking about while writing this script after watching epsiode 14. and what is he trying to convey after this story ends. Seo Kang Joon Fighting! I understand both sides of the argument whether YJ should be vilified or that she had deep emotional problems that JY, in his immaturity, could not or would not empathize with. SE has her own insecurities that has now cast a shadow over her relationship with JY. Perhaps due to the emotional baggage the main and supporting characters have it might be best if none of them end up with each other. I prefer JY and YJ move on... JY with SE married... YJ and HC reunited. I\\'m happy to know that there are still a few people who are understanding the female lead. No matter what she has done, if she has learnt her mistake, she must be given a chance. The second breakup wasn\\'t just her fault. JY was responsible too. You want to be realistic yet you are shipping JY with SE when you know it\\'s wrong for SE. Don’t look at the rating, believe me this is the best drama How can you throw a shade to a female lead? She’s suffer alot in the drama, her children died, her bestfriend have cancer, how can all of you hate her? Ugh, I hate how many people are hating on the female lead again. I bet if their roles were reversed y\\'all would defend the (hot) male lead. I want Se Eun and Joon Young to end up with each other Young Jae destroyed herself and changed the life of Joon Young at the same time. She\\'s the source of the problem of the guy since the beginning. She\\'s a complicated girl. The guy was extremely jealous because she didn\\'t reject the other guy who chased her and she blamed him for that impulsive jealousy. But in the end his jealousy were right cuz the two ended together somehow. Well it`s the JY - YJ`s - story, Se Eun doesn`t have a place in between. I love joon young character. I don\\'t like main actress bcz of her role. My hurt ache bcz of joon young? The story had a great start. It was light and filled with romantic excitement until Joon Young and Young Jae\\'s 2nd break up that lead them to live different lives. Now, I don\\'t wish them to reunite. I prefer Se Eun for Joon Young as the story continues. I wish Joon Young and Young Jae can both move on from their past and be happy with their own lives. I dont like Se Eun, she\\'s a loser.I hope JY and YJ to be happy they deserve it. Im loving the story. but for me, i dont want young jae and joon young to reunite. I want Se Eun and Joon Young to end up with each other. and hoping that Joon Young will end his lingering feelings towards young jae. Watched latest episode and didnt like where it seems to be leading....the characters in this story are all pathetic. Too bad it had a nice start to it. The first breakup was manageable....the second breakup and the current storyline is exasperating for me. I dont know it i would want to stick around to how the story will end because it just is too painful to watch the main male lead get suckered once again... I know that love has not a reason and depend on time-period. Anyhow, writes should to have a reason and concern to real-life situation, they should not push the burden to audiences to think and connect any clues by themselves. This drama is just ripping my heart out. Have you noticed the writers gave us all the events in JY life after they broke up, but we are just getting a few of YJ’s events. Like, how did she end up with the doctor? She had turned him down before her break up. Also, why did they get a divorce? Why are we supposed to assume it was all because of the death of their child and drinking. Why did she end up abroad? It would be nice if we could get all of her story like the writers so graciously gave up JY’s story. I love the drama. Reality. and i am hoping that chef on will be married to se-un. They both deserve to be happy. Among others, they need to stay strong since their marriage is about to happen. Please.... lets not be poisoned that lead stars supposed to end the story happily. Fighting chef and se-un I love JY YJ sweet story in the begining. Funny, sweet, cute and romantics. But why after ep 12 becoming endless tragic stories of YJ? SPOILER: WoW! really really a big WOW!!! What\\'s wrong with this writer: first the brother broke his back , then the sister lost her child and now the best friend has cancer. Unnecessary and overkill dramatization for the main storyline. Give Min Se Eun goddam role I felt really heartbroken since ep12. However, i\\'m still hoping that YJ would end up happy again with JY ❤ OH! I really love this drama! So realistic and relatable. Couldnt agree more. The directors, the writer, the cast, the crew, all of them a thousand thumbs up! Great work I really enjoyed this drama until they f*** up YJ\\'s character. She was so ambitious and courageous and then bam her life went upside down even more. They made her character so stupid into marrying jerk guy and then randomly a baby. I still root for JY&YJ. SE is sweet and weird, too much in common may not always indicate a good relationship, tbh their scenes are so boring. This drama was good in the beginning and then it just went sour. abort. abort. just stop watching. save yourself. People wanting JY to go after YJ claiming she loves him , she broke his heart in more than one occasion, married another man , non other than the douche-bag she told JY she has nothing to do with him but in fact encouraged him to pursue her, had his child and from what we could see was very happy (she pursued her happiness and nobody should hold that against but on the other hand don\\'t say she loves JY) , she lost her child (i guess if you lose your child in all movies/series this days is equivalent to Driking/Drug abuse and marriage death). I love this drama so much, every character is realistic and relatable. Has anyone notice that Young Jae is the 3rd girl to appear when Joon Young was waiting for his blind date? And the drama also has 3 main couples, JYxYJ, SJxJR and SHxRW. Fate brings Joon Young to Young Jae to help her be happy and vice versa, Young Jae has hurted him deeply but it was unintentional and she only does what she thinks is best for him, because that time, she is slowly changing and keeping secrets from Joon Young, she thought Joon Young doesn\\'t deserve that, hence the reason why she broke up with him, because she feel like she\\'s not good enough. Now the unexpected twist happened after 5 years, Young Jae is now a divorcee after failing marriage with Ho Chul and losing their child:( and Joon Young engaged to Se Eun. These are the times where Young Jae needs to hold onto someone to show her light in the darkness and Joon Young is that person. I know some people say she took Joon Young for granted, maybe at certain points but not always, in fact she doesn\\'t want that to happen because she love him, so she break things up with him. Now we\\'ll get to see how the third time is really the charm. Proves we should keep trying and never stop giving up, also staying true to our feelings so we\\'ll have no regrets in life. The drama started out as lighthearted and fun, turned into something addicting, them frustrating, heart breaking and healing.. this drama is a hidden gem, if only could people see its true worth. Salute to everyone part of this drama especially to SEO KANG JOON and ESOM. They are very versatile actors. Super recommended 1000000000000+/10 ^_^ so much pain in this drama, of course for young jae,please PDnim,give her fair life,give her eternal happiness,i wanna she her smile again,and i don\\'t wanna see joon young with the police woman,if young jae has to be single,joon young must single too! Istg I don\\'t understand of people that saying JY struggling more than YJ. Bet yall cant tolerate the feeling of losing their beloved ones, like forever. Cant even see them again. Yes, that\\'s what YJ must feel. Love isn\\'t about boy and girl. But mom to her child too! Yall too cruel to YJ. Tsk, I really hope if they end up with each other, Young Jae is the one who\\'ll make the effort this time, I feel like she\\'s only going with the flow. If not, I wish she\\'d end up single and focus more on achieving her dreams, she\\'s capable on her own and I think she sucks at relationships, look at what happened with her marriage, maybe it\\'s telling her to stop and look for other things that can make her happy I have a bad feeling about the police officer lady... she may not be the sweet person we all think she is...probably she has something to do with their separation...I don’t t know maybe YJ found out she was pregnant, went to look for JY at the police station but he was gone. Went to look for him in Portugal but SE knowing YJ was pregnant (maybe already showing)..,went first to Portugal to confess and YJ saw them together..,? I should become a drama writer..? i just wanna joon young and young jae back together,in every way:( I should say that till episode 10-9 I thought it will be just the same drama and so so ... but I appreaciate the writer , she is awesome! I think the child was old enough to be Joon-Young’s child and Young-Jae married the doctor because Joon-Young left the country and she didn’t get to tell him. It’s getting interesting.... hate young jae chatacter. I l prefer to se eun SPOILER ALERT! I’ve watched Ep 13 and I have to say I really want to know what happened to young Jae. It seems like her and the doctor had a child maybe??? And what I mean by had, I think the child may have gotten into an accident and died and to say she got married and we didn’t even see any of this. So hopefully in the next episodes we get to see it. Wishing for young Jae and Young Joon to become one again. I just don\\'t know why people wants make lead pair again.. we can\\'t choose who will we fall far... same goes to joon young who fall hard for young jae even though he knows obviously that young jae characters is the opposite from him ( they explained it in the beginning of the episode when they met for the first time). It\\'s upto the writers now on how they can salvage the story properly. 4 more episodes. Though It\\'s fine to have JY be with the cop, I can see some insecurities and uncertainties in their relationship. And for YJ and HC, I don\\'t really see any love. JY\\'s reaction is very different from HC and YJ\\'s reaction when they saw each other. I\\'m so stressed watching ep.12,my heart going to burst...pls give it justice for original couple... i miss u young jae and joon young couple? I just can’t wait where the director will take the story? just please give it justice or I’ll never get over this drama? I am so stress right now after watching episode 12. Joon-young is happy when he\\'s with Young-jae. He even do more sacrifices to save their relationship before. He do love Young-jae but Joon-young is too good for her. I want Se-eun for him and I think that\\'s enough. eps 1-4 is OK, 5-12 like whatttt??i mean what happen with the writer,they supposed to reveal what\\'s wrong with young jae soon:( I hate the fact that Young jae is still roaming around Joon young. Young Jae is the most selfish female lead I had ever seen. I mean C\\'mon how the heck can you marry someone on whim your boyfriend doubted. On the top of that she even had a child in time of five years. And now the writer must not bring Young Jae loving Joon Young thrash. I mean it\\'s clear if her daughter wouldn\\'t have died she would have been happy with that doctor and had easily forgotten about Joon Young. I really want Joon Young to end up with that cop. Joon Young too must not marry Young Jae and leave that Policewoman. After watching the episode 12, I am like “Okay.. I’m so done with this drama” one of the few dramas i regret watching.. so disappointed with the writers as they did not give justice to young-jae’s character.. i would appreciate if they just made her successful but feeling empty and lonely.. i admired her character at first beacuse she was a strong woman, determined and independent.. she already dumped the doctor and it was clear that he was not the reason of their breakup.. very very disappointed!?????? if only this will be their 3rd meeting, better end the drama on episode 10! She break up to Joon young and married to the doctor? I think the baby is Joon Young..? this drama is getting better and better. i do not know why i like this kind of drama. The drama has too many problems they can’t even spend one episode without them getting mad over one petty little thing like just break up and end the relationship at this point. They both irritating me. The only reason I’m continuing the drama is because of Seo Kang Joon. I really hope joon young will end up together with young jae. Dont like joon young with the female cop.??? i hate the ep 11..it makes me sad...i hate the policewoman... thank you,i am done with this drama:) I can\\'t help but ship se eun and joon young ♡ they both look good together esp when i heard the first scene wherein it shows that they\\'re a couple... i thought,\"I hope it\\'ll end with this, with them.\" Young Jae and Joon Young doesn\\'t work out even tho they\\'ve tried a lot but i know that they\\'ll definitely end up because theyre the lead but i just hope they won\\'t. I know Young Jae was just thinking of Joon Young\\'s feelings but .... Se Eun please? Ship for Joon Young and Se Eun! I hate this episode,i mean reallyyy???i don\\'t mind if joon young and young jae aren\\'t together anymore,but i hate joon young with woman cop and young jae with the doctor.I want something more from last 5 episode:( please PD Nim be kind to us This drama was interesting. I love ep 10 i do hope Joon young marries Se Eun in the end. I want young Jae to end up sorry and lonely and will regret what she did to Joon young for hurting him not only ones but twice. And the second time becomes more painful to Joon young because he is about to propose to her for marriage. There are too much hate for Youngjae when she\\'s just being herself to priorities her career more than her current love life. (See? People will judge us when we are being real with ourselves) And istg the antagonist here is yall because Youngjae never got seduced by the doctor YET yall saying that they deserve each other because both of them are selfish. Yes, Youngjae is selfish but STILL he loves Joonyoung the most. I am falling for Joon Young-Se Eun pairing and it makes me sad because it is so obvious they will not end up together because Young Jae is the female lead. It\\'s painful to not be reciprocated in love when you have done nothing but been honest about your feelings . She did not love him back (demonstrated again and again loud and clear) , the writer(s) made it as he understood that and moved on. I hope they don\\'t disturbed his new found love by some bullshit excuse (she loved him but ... and he still loves her ......) . To those seeing the doctor as a selfish douchebag , i agree but the biggest douchebag of them all is the girl that each time he did something douchbagy , she did nothing to cut him off instead she encouraged him to do more. I love Joon young with Se eun after ep 10. Young jae with ho chul would be perfect. Joon young to good for young jae, she didnt deserve him. recommended by a friend, i usually prefer joseon k-drama to watch.. but this drama really good, i love the story line and all the cast Poor joon young. I cry, episode 10? It\\'s ok young jae,everybody hates u on your 27yo,but remember,everybody has their own mistakes,move on from your past,change ur mindset,i know u love joon young but u can\\'t express it bcoz u r get used to be alone since ur brother accident,u stand alone to provide ur brother, without everybody cheer u up. Young jae became materialistic and ambitious because she lives in poverty since she was young so she didn\\'t go to college. Nothing is perfect in this world,especially in a relationship, sometimes we are selfish, irritating,rejecting,happy,jealous. But in the end,love will meet his way:) Hwaiting Joon young and Young Jae. Love this drama so much, wondering why u guys get a low rating for this cute,brilliant,heart warming,daily love story,?? hope the ending will be good and happy,no cliffhanging pleaseee? Young Jae is too mean:( Now I wouldn\\'t mind if she ended up with the doctor. They are both selfish. Anyway a very lovely and sad drama, I\\'m not even in a relationship but I can feel their suffering:( Although this love story is complex and irritating at times, I can very well see why Seo Kang Joon choose this drama to play Oh Joon Young. It\\'s a very detailed character with a complexity of emotion and playing this character will improve his acting. I really love this drama. So much that I can relate it to my present and past relationships. I understand why joonyoung act like that. I just want him to find someone who respects and treat him better. Youngjae and the selfish ignorant doctor can get together. Even it\\'s just a little swayed by another person approach, it should still called cheating. She doesn\\'t deserve joonyoung at all. Why am I getting worked up on this btw? I dont know why this drama got low ratting. More Min Se-Eun pls The doctor really annoyed me! Isn\\'t he realized that young jae already has a boyfriend? Ah, he realized it, he even asking for permission to confess his feeling to young jae with her boyfriend. I thought this format would only be great in movings but they manage to make it in drama format with a very goooooood approach/execution and a lof of interesting issues about relationship to tackle. Beautiful drama, I\\'m lost for words?? Although I would like a happy ending for Joon Young and Young Jae, realistically I don\\'t think that would be the best outcome of this drama. Joon Young is maturing but has too great a lack of confidence and self-respect. His comfort zone and life style goals do not match with Young Jae. He does a lot for her out of love and need for approval with little in return. Young Jae has had a taste of the limelight and success and it is the doctor that can give her the prestige to offset her current diminishing lack of confidence and lead to the rich life style she desires. Young Jae and the doctor are two of the most selfish characters that I have seen in Kdramas over the years and deserve each other. Joon Young should connect with someone who will return the love that he so generously gives and leave Young Jae who takes him for granted. Latest episode is very sad. I cried so much T__T poor Joon Young, he can feel Young Jae changing too, that time when he was fixing the radio and a tear came down from his face. Young Jae, you got yourself a good man willing to do sacrifice and do anything for you, just try to understand his dedication to things a bit more because that\\'s what makes him unique, and your relationship will become stronger. Fighting! I continue to love this , every episode keeps on getting better and I\\'m starting to understand more the characters and their inner feelings Great drama but it\\'s too sad:((( I miss the happy moments, I hate that doctor he\\'s so annoying!! Don\\'t make Young Jae confused and follow someone who\\'s in a relationship!!! He also used how he\\'s a divorcee to gain sympathy tsk tsk.. maybe the reason why your wife really left you because you\\'r eso full of yourself!!! I dont understand why Young Jae still not saying stop to the doctor and always listen to his confessions about his love, I think she will choose him because they are the same. They thought the countryside is boring and anything else, the latest episode show the big difference between her and Joon Young, and it showed how Joon Young loved her more maybe that\\'s why she kept on thinking and look bothered. I think on the last ep JoonYoung was tearful not because he was jealous but because he can feel that Young Jae will leave him... Very interesting.. joon young is the type who will fix a radio cause it has sentimental value, young jae is the type who will buy a new one to make things easier. joon young thinks living in a countryside with the one you love will be nice and young jae thinks it will still be boring, but joon young said if she prefers to live the city, then he\\'s okay with it as long as she is happy and they are together, i think on joon young likes young jae very much that he can give up those he like for her, but i think young jae since she\\'s a realist is starting to doubt that their relationship won\\'t go long cause of their differences? maybe she also feel undeserving of joon young and blame herself for seeing ho chul. Love this drama i will watch til the end thanks. Love this drama.. i\\'m on episode 5 and On Joon Young is such a sweetheart hahaha emotional everytime i watch this drama. cant wait for episode 9. i wonder how the second break up will happen. my heart hurts but i cant stop loving this show This drama is giving me so many feels;_; if I have to describe it in one word it\\'s BEAUTIFUL ❤❤❤ We support you Young Jae with that doctor ( Ho Chul ):) I ship lead actor x side actor. Joon Young x Se Eun and Young Jae x Ho Chul. Trust me i dont know why theres a lot negative comment about Young Jae character. i know, many people here feel young jae feels not big as well joon young, and theres people doesnt like it because its feels slow. I watch this only for seo kang joon....!! Didn\\'t expect I will love the story as well ♥♥♥ can\\'t wait for episode 9 huhuhu please!! drama feels meh. the supporting characters are more interesting than the main leads. don\\'t waste your time on this one unless you like slow dramas Finally a change of character for the lovely Kim Yoon Hye. It\\'s refreshing to see her in this new kind of role and I knew the moment she will step in, people will ship her character with Seo Kang Joon cause they both look youthful compared to Esom and Min Woo Hyuk who looks more matured. Am I also the one who feel like Young Jae doesn\\'t love Joon Young the same way he loves her? I mean looking at the amount of texts she has received from him, cheering her on for her interview and pictorial, compared to when she knew Joon Young will be on a dangerous stakeout, he even called her to say how nervous he is, yet it seems like she has forgotten about it when she came rushing to see THAT doctor? She also PUT ASIDE reading her brother Soo Jae\\'s script just to see that doctor, yet she CAN\\'T made one call to check on what happened on Joon Young\\'s mission? She\\'s also the last person to realize he is in a hospital, even his best friend Sang Hyun came first. IDK if this continues, I\\'ll probaby lose my sympathy for Young Jae, and I\\'ll start rooting for Se Eun. Who knows if the third time\\'s charm will work with a different person? After 2 failed relationships with the same person ^^ Also the reason why THAT doctor hasn\\'t given up on Young Jae is because she hasn\\'t clearly shut him down. GIRL you have an absolutely caring boyfriend. Don\\'t go with a doctor who uses his past wounds to get your symphaty and also he\\'s a guy who knew you have a boyfriend, so cocky to think what he is doing is right.. Yoon young sister ri won and sang hyun ship have already began sailing I have been shipping them together finally???? I think young jae took joon young feelings for granted cos he’s always jealous and all now how does it feel to get a taste of your own medicine I wonder if YJ will be pissed at JY even though just earlier, she listened to HC sing romantically to her? But I do think YJ is going to get a bit insecure esp since seeing her boyfriend treat someone else like a \\'princess\\'. However, I do have to say the chemistry with YJ with Officer Min is really really good . . . like them simply bonding over food (which the show is probs going to show does not mean direct soulmates) was so adorable - even more than the premise of the show. Wow ep 8 ending scene, more Joon Young and Officer Min scene pls, they are so cute together, just like Young Jae and that doctor btw I hope they finished it until episode 16?? i am very curious what the ending be like, please don’t cut the episodes????? i love the storyline so much See? A lot of people support Min Se-Eun, she is so cute i love this drama so much,heart warming,realistic,can\\'t wait for portugal scene!and i am curious what happen on their 32yo,will there be marriage or not The nerve of that doctor!!? I wish youngjae and joonyoung break up, their relationship is toxic. Joonyoung suit seeun better. Min Se-Eun is coming to snatch your bf, min se eun will be good girlfriend, imo i am stop at ep 3? first I saw Seo Kang-Joon in Are You Human Too, i\\'m already fall in love:) I like the plot so much.. I like how deep Joon Young love her n can do anything for her.. I like Yong Jae too, She is strong woman.. No wonder if Joon Young fall for her As far as I can remember, this is a realistic and heart-wrenching drama about ordinary people who can\\'t stop breaking up and fall in love again, what do other people expect?.. Im watching this with my husband and we\\'re loving it sooooo much!!!!! ❤❤❤ Im wondering why there has not been sounded the first ost Hae Jae in any of scene? In the other hand it may be sound in their 3rd charm in 5 years...The script is so refresh and naive but still characters are not deep I hope I won\\'t end up watching this show until half of the total episodes. Because the beginning of this drama was really sweet and eye catching, continue to episode by episode was really boring. It\\'s like Predictable. But I won\\'t talk much I will wait for the ending episode. And I also hope this show isn\\'t like something in the rain (I compare) that I stop watching at eps 10. Look for the great storyline forward:) Joon young actually has the right to be jealous, imagine yourself in his place. You saw your gf with another guy who you know has feelings for her, and when he opened up how he really feels to young jae, young jae came up with \"why are you calling him jerk\" instead of saying \"trust me i don\\'t like him\" so it provoke joon young more, hey that\\'s actually what he\\'s so sensitive about, i don\\'t mean to say he is right but cmon, he wouldn\\'t go overboard if you know the right thing to say, you just keep on adding to his suspicions. Now imagine if young jae will pick ho chul, joon young will think it\\'s his fault again, young jae always makes him feel bad abot himself and always practicing guilt trip and playing victim. In this situation, I think it\\'s best for them to break up. can we skip to the 32 year old version of them? But overall, great drama and portrayals:D I think they will broke up bec of following reasons: Please more episodes pleaseeeee...... sarange from india❤❤ That\\'s a kind doctor you got there the story is good. i love the cast but then the ending of every episodes so far, is vague. it feels like you dont want to watch the next episode since the scene you\\'re watching is kinda off with the ending. it\\'s like i\\'m always waiting for something good to happen but then the ending scene always makes me feel it will never come. and it is annoying. just change every flow of the ending and it\\'s all good! make us look forward for the next episode instead of leaving us hanging and in a very bad mood for not having an ending that will make our day complete and satisfied. Another interesting episode. Joon Young is supposed to be sensitive even on small things that\\'s why I get where his jealousy and insecurity is coming from =( I hope these will make the 32 year old version of them stronger, most heartbreaking episode along w/ ep 2, and i noticed the parallels, how So Hee and a misunderstanding is involved again. But this time it\\'s Joon Young who avoids Young Jae. This drama is very intriguing, hope the ratings will rise again Very heartwarming and adorable drama Lmao I laugh til I cried, this drama is just so perfect. I thought it will be full of cliche and cringey scenes bec it\\'s rom com but I was wrong. Totally enjoyable and I love the beautiful messages it delivers. It has a slice of life feel <333333 btw Happy Birthday On Joon Young!!! <3 I\\'m here for Esom , love her acting so much. Their chemistry is incredible and perfect. Now i\\'m huge fan of this series . This series is so lovely and sweet!! If u haven\\'t try , pls try this. Love you both and love this sweet drama I don\\'t really like their chemistry but let\\'s see how it goes. Both actors are great individually but something feels off. I don\\'t know if it\\'s the actors that are too strong (talent-wise) for these roles or the characters are written/directed too shallow and weak. I just can\\'t feel a great chemistry between them yet. But it\\'s only been 4 episodes so let\\'s see how it goes. Totally love On family though. This drama is so beautiful and refreshing, realistic characters and splendid acting, my happy pill and stress reliever ♡ I am loving Seo Kang Joon in this drama. I\\'m already an Esom so I\\'m eager to see what these two are like together. This drama seems promising:-) Enjoy the drama so far, make me laugh, smile and cry also.. Good job for SKJ and Esom. Hope the rating getting better and better until 2 digits maybe? The writers did a great job with the parallel of young jae and joon young meeting again. 1. meeting in the police station after young jae was wrongly accused bec she did something good for others, and joon young came to back her up. 2. when joon young get drunk 3. kissing at a perfect moment in salon What happened to Lee Soo jae\\'s girlfriend? Even in the cast list her name wasn\\'t there even if she\\'s just a cameo or what This drama is super fun and addicting!! My new stress reliever and On Joon Young is so cool and cute too!!! I love the realistic approach, I\\'m relieving some old memories with my boyfriend, such a nostalgic and wonderful feeling!!!! I love this drama, so much fun. Can\\'t wait the new ep every week. Fighting!!! Love the storyline pretty like everyday life and easy going so realistic and they’re so adorable ep4 got me hooked I can’t wait for more episodes Can anyone please tell me what\\'s the title of the song played at the end of episode 3? kind of slow love song..thanks! On Joon Young is so cute ❤❤❤ The drama is so good.And the chemistry of the leads is through the roof. This series got me hooked especially from episode 2 onwards. Can\\'t wait for the next episode. I don\\'t know what exactly it is that tugged my heartstrings. Never a dull moment. Love the drama, the cast, the story and everything. So funny... SEO KANG JOON\\'s acting very superb. Definitely must watch kdrama!! This somehow keeps on getting better, Joon Young and Young Jae are so adorable!!! Stay strong!!! Another week of waiting The drama, the cast, the story and everything are really superb. Its a true romcom kdrama. Fun, cute, and emotional also. So in love with on joon young. Kang joon\\'s acting is really superb. He is obviously not just has a super handsome face, but he really is can act. The gesture, facial ekspressions, the way he talks and his voice as a nerd so on point. Feel so sad when he cried cos breakup with young jae. Not a great drama. The first 2 episodes were cool, but now I don\\'t even understand were it\\'s heading to. What\\'s the plot? Two people liking each other? Ehhh... that\\'s the base of almost all kdramas! Some scenes are unnecessary, and the acting is so-so, which is disappointing because I used to like the main actors. Not sure I understand the editing flow either. When most of the time you wonder why the editor chose to put one scene next to another, that\\'s no good. I shouldn\\'t even notice the editing if it was well done... You can\\'t just put frames afters frames and expect it to make a story! I\\'ll pass on this one. Don\\'t want to waste my time. Just watched the 1st episode and all I can say is I\\'d choose nerd Kang Joon rather than those 3 guys lol nerd Kang Joon is actually still hotter than those 3 xD Such a fun drama, I\\'m already in love with it. The characters are so relatable. No unnecessary scenes and the comedy is played out well:) Esom rarely do dramas but when she does, we know it\\'s gonna be a good one. Loved the first two episodes! Can\\'t wait for tomorrow <3 My favorite ongoing drama! ^^ Pretty straightforward and the story warms my heart, best performance from Seo Kang Joon and Esom. Can\\'t wait to see more of the very beautiful Lee Yoon Ji~~ I watched because of Se Kang joon.. wow this drama is way better than what i expected! definitely worth to watch~ Ah I love Seo Kang Joon so much!! He takes so much time in perfecting his roles. From facial expressions to overall mannerisms it\\'s amazing. I like the 1st 2 episodes and will be here for the long haul. I was hesitant about Esom, but she is doing great as well and I really like her in this role. I love this drama already and not even done the first episode yet. Nerdy Seo Kang Joon is the cutest thing ever, he plays this role well. Is that LISBON I see on the promotional poster? Did they come here to film the drama?? Oh, no! The beautiful Seo Kang-Joon, what did you do to him? LOL I love Sep kang jo on oppa and hope that this drama will be a success shot for him. see you tonight... I\\'m a big fan of both Seo Kang Joon and Esom, I\\'m sure they will put a splendid performance, 2 more days left!!!! This seems so sweet and refreshing yet I know from glimpses from the teasers there will be heartbreaking scenes. I\\'m gonna watch this because Esom won me over in BTIMFL and who can resist Seo Kang-Joon?! It\\'s gonna be a wild ride for sure <3 @Yunyun Chuseok holiday in Korea:) Can someone tell me why is The Third Charm premiere is on September 28th instead of the end of this week? Omg two very amazing actors! Fighting Seo Kang Joon oppa and Esom unnie! Your chemistry is showing, the drama hasn\\'t even started yet ❤❤❤ Can\\'t wait for this drama. I love SJK and he\\'s a really good actor. the best teaser of the year.  Seo Kang Joon ssi getting recognized... great job! After portraying the sweet lovable Nam Shin III, I\\'m not surprised at his character description here. Will watch this bcos Esom??? Seo Kang Joon is Back Hope Koreans appreciate his talent more since the leads are announced i\\'d excited and promise to must watch this drama. well, i\\'d waited for long time to see Seo Kang Joon in realistic rom-com genre again and this will be lit! i hope a lot with this storyline. the teaser are just... i\\'m so into it. keep fighting for all actors, PD-nim, writer-nim and all crews. Cutie kang joon... bravo omg, i already know im gonna love it.. i love series where the main couple are already together! I so love Seo Kang-Joon since Cheese in the trap days. More projects to come! Fighting! <3 I need teaser now please!! Nuno you were lucky...lol...I wish we would know sooner and we would be there just to watch a bit of the shooting. It\\'s in Lisbon? At least the only photo Esom posted on her InstaStories looked that way. It was a nigh shoot with a bycicle involved. Finally they come and film part of a drama here.:) @Tybolt, she is one of the main characters and she don\\'t fit to be the lead role in this kind of plot. I\\'m sure all actors and actresses will work hard and carry this drama together not only Lee Yoon Ji. Love her tho They\\'re filming right now at my doorstep Can\\'t wait for this drama!! I\\'m so glad that Esom is the lead role Lee Yoon Ji will carry this drama (despite, once again, being cast in the second lead spot) just as she does in nearly every other one that she appears in. Looking forward to seeing her in her latest venture... OMG! Love both of them, Esom and KSJ!!! I am so happy to see Seo Kang joon on screen again after Are You Human Too KBS drama ended.Keep going, I\\'ll support you. DAMN. seo kang joon ssi~ im gonna miss your character on Are you human too? . I already ship you with Gong Seung Yeon in real life. Are you human too is about to be finished so I can\\'t wait for this drama to finally air (although I\\'m loving My ID is Gangnam Beauty so much and I will miss it when it ends lol). I adoreeeed Essom in Because This Is My First Life so I\\'m super excited to see her as très female lead, next to my number 1 favorite actor, Seo Kang Joon? The Third Charm, fighting! i do think that Esom is a good actress but i don\\'t think she will look good with SKJ. Yeah i think it will be quite weird tho:P Esom is so pretty and a talented actress, I\\'m so happy she\\'s Kang Joon\\'s pair. Love both of them! Excited for this:) I really love aeo kang joon he is my fav since o saw him kn chesse in trap ..but i dont like eosm ..i wish he come leading role in this drama with ...kim seul gi ..( both from actress age of youth ..ryu hwa young. Han seung yeon .).. im excited to watch this drama, seo kang joon you\\'re amazing.. you\\'ve have it all.. go fighting oppa... i will watch all your drama series.. im hoping some day i will see you in person.. Kang Joon is thriving this year! 3 drama roles and maybe more.. I love both of the main leads. Can\\'t wait for this drama.? Very excited towards Kang joon\\'s new drama Excited to see different kang joon.',\n",

       "  'comments': 'I will continue to say \"OCN Never Fails\" Hey Guys!! The Best & Daebak! OCN Action/Law/Comedy has ever produced am happy for Song Seung-Heon for getting back, lets face it his drama Black receive a lot of negative review TBH it was really an Epic Fail. I can\\'t wait for season 2, please OCN. I want season 2 so bad. My new fav. team <3 I really love the story. This drama is like \"The Thieves\" but made into a series. This drama is so underrated! I was shocked to see low ratings for this. One of the best dramas of 2018! best drama ever uwu Season 2 please Omg the tattoo man is incredebly hot:\\') all casts are so impressive OMG, really love the all things in this drama, also the plot is unpredictable ♥️♥️ this is the best action korean drama ever OMG??? i am so disappointed to know that this drama is over. season 2 please??? The best ever..season 2 please? It’s Superb! I enjoyed watching this drama . God job. I hope to see another season for this drama! Looking forward if there is season 2! I enjoy watching this drama, its been awhile i watch korea drama and this is totally a good drama- must watch list checked! luckily the ending was not as disappointing compared to other dramas (which sometimes left you hanging) but this has a slight western touch which i quite like it. It does reminds me to the US series of Leverage, well played for all main characters, keep it up! no love romance scene, if you’re expecting it, this is not the drama. Its all suspense, wanting to know whats next, mystery and think outside the box drama. 10/10! This drama was amazing. I enjoyed every single second of it and it really was worth the binge watch. The bonds between the characters were stunning. The show was aired with the just amount of episodes so the plot was coherent and didn\\'t drag for too long. The humour and seriousness were well balanced in the show; each was portrayed within its appropriate moment. The antagonist was beautifully played which contributed to the credibility of the show. The action scenes were irrefutably daebak. Props and thanks to the writer, those who contributed in producing such a masterpiece, and of course to the talented actors who portrayed their characters perfectly. I totally recommend this drama and if there is a chance, I hope to see another season. i really enjoyed of watching this drama...all actor and actress played in superb character..i love song seung-heon...cant wait for his next dramas... Omg omg. They should make part 2. Prosecutor Jang still alive. Byung MIn was sooo good getting all the data even he got brutally beaten that day. 1 More Episodeee!! This Drama is So Good Like i\\'ve waited for almost 1 month to end this wahhh like daebakkk the story is so good... I Like the 4 characters this drama a con artist a fighter a hacker and a driver it is so perfectly when you combined that 4 2 more episodes, can\\'t believe it, this is such amazing drama, too bad its coming to an end. I hope that prosecutor Jang will stay alive, it\\'s such a waste to let him die, I think that he also plays an important role in this show, I would be very sad if he die and very mad at the writer, a few broken bones would be enough but please don\\'t let him die, I like him as much as the other 4 characters. This drama reminds me of \"stranger\" the one with donna bae in it, it\\'s also about crime and corruption within the government... but this one got some comedy, still good though. I like Song Seung-Heon, welcome back oppa its been a long time after the BLACK in fairness the ratings was really good, well its given that all the cast are good. the actor who plays \\'that person\\' (if this is the one with the chestnurs in his hand) ... who is this? seems familiar somehow but i cannot connect him to a name If Prosecutor Jang is really dead, I will be disappointed with writernim. I like Prosecutor Jang very much. Love this drama! SSH is superb and love the team! #PLAYER❤ The best drama of 2018 finally good quality drama has arrived and no romance?? really sick with all those same love story in kdrama land krystal here looks like someone else. like 1 actress i forgot who. but if i didnt see the news this drama has krystal, i dont think i\\'ll know its her. the 1st 6th episode were great but when they decide to play the plain old higher power in the making with plot twist of the twist of the plot twist it dropped my interest so much. who is the girl who played as Soon Hanna? does anyone know? i like that there is \"romance\"/love-line. it means that the story is strong even without it, and sometimes the audience gets a bit tired of the same-old-same-old. think of the \"Defendant\"-- there was no romance in that one, but it was a solid story and very popular: it had a A-list actor as the main (just like this one), and was superb. i think this is the same. very solid story, cinematography, chemistry of the a-team, spot-on music (the instrumentals and i love that jinshil/dok2 song), sprinkling of humor, etc... superb drama, i love it so far. Cheering for Song Seung-Heon:) My First ever Oppa!!!!! Love u.. Seeing SSH and Kim Won Hae together reminds me of Black... I just started watching this and I am loving it so much!From the funny lines to the soundtrack! Love it all! Woww best drama!! Episode 7 make so frust because of that girl girl.. damn those fake lawyer that why his smile so f**king creepy Guys, I\\'m not entirely sure if you guys know this but the cast has said that there would be no romance between any of the four main characters. When they were on \\'life Bar\\', they highly denied the possibility of having a love-line in the drama. fall in love with this drama and Krystal:D Is there will be romance between ha ri and ah ryung? if you want to watch a kdrama something LIKE The Player then watch: Love the drama??, but why there is no romance yet? Reminds me of 38 task force and i really love this kind of drama I was really looking forward to this drama because of Krystal and Song Seung-heon and i was slightly disappointing by the first episode but it\\'s starting to pick up now (currently at 4th episode). Amazing drama plus my favourite actor Song Seung Heon??? This drama is amazing. Yes ,for sure no romance yet. But the way how they make it so fresh. I look forward to this drama. Kim Sung cheol and Krystal were in the same drama Prison Playbook. A con artist, hacker, and with the help of two other people, this plot is so boring. Guess what, all their plan to steal from bad people will turn out to be successful just like Switch. Boring level 999 Do Jin-Woong caught my attention it would be interesting if there would be a Movie or Drama between him and Ma Dong-Seok This is really amazing show. Somehow it reminds me of mad dog went with little expectations but WOW only 2 eps but i am already hooked! no doubt its a 10/10 movie. action, comedy, suspense, it’s got it all!!! highly highly recommended for all i expected more from the team especially in the first two episodes...but they don\\'t seem like a crack team. Hacker not convincing enough. If you ahve watched Japan drama, Border you will know what I mean. Yoo seung hoo??? Cameoo? Hhahahha... Omg this is soo weird. Without knowing that SSH has a new drama, I dreamed about him last night. It\\'s a \\'safe\\' dream though｜*￣∇￣｜ first ep was so bomb like omg this is the kind of dramas i love. Fighting to all actors and actresses I\\'m so ready for sassy preen king Song Seung Heon lol The plot seems to be a bit similar to Swindlers (because of the hacking thing and swindlers), the Jang Geun seuk’s Switch: Change the World (bec of law enforcers, crime and hacking and swindlers), and lookout (kdrama, bec hacking and crime solving). But im really curious how this drama will grow, and im watching too bec of Krystal and SSH!!!!! The synopsis reminds me to this drama http://asianwiki.com/Squad_38 i don\\'t think that the plot looks good..yeah i will watch him(Song Seung-Heon) later, cannot waitttt!!! I could watch it a bit because of Krystal casting... but I know I\\'m not gonna finish. OCN dramas feels all the same. Voice 2 is so Good. Watch the First Season so you aren’t lost. As soon as this Drama ENDS Player drama with Song SeungHeon & Lee SiEon starts. I can’t wait! @Marie IKR ... Say GoodBye to channel KBS , SBS , MBC .. Say hello and welcome to DAEBAK channel TVN , OCN , JBTC ... It will replace Voice 2. Why are ocn dramas soo good?! <3 I\\'m here for Lee Si-un Can\\'t wait this drama I was watched kshow I Lived Alone, when Henry and kian84 do a video call to Lee Si Eon.. it was show a set on drama in a car while Krystal take driver seat, i wondering what kind of drama set Lee Si Eon do with Krystal Jung. And after googling it, i found this!! Can\\'t wait to see them both in this drama? Cannot wait this drama,Plot look interresting....Krystal Hwaiting!! i love all the movies from SSH, I\\'m excited to watch the PLAYER K-drama, 14 eps only? The plot looks simple. I wonder how they will spice it up. Anyway, I\\'m in because of Song Seung Heon. pls dont ruin the plot TT TT It looks like SSH moved from Crystal Liu to Krystal Jung. So, the current trend of drama is about law enforcers. But every one of them is different in their own way. I am curious as how Player will be different from the other drama with similar theme. Excited for a new drama with Krystal since she is an up and coming actress with tremendous potential and charisma. She is beautiful, talented, and has a huge fan base. hmmm, i have enough crime drama... SSH Ex-girlfriend, her name is also Crystal, and now he is paired with an actress named the same as his ex-girlfriend.Hehe Ooohhh interesting love oppa in black and Krystal of course so pretty Well his ex-girlfriend id also named Crystal? I thought its her lol',\n",

I wasn\\'t going to watch this because I kind of hate sports themed shows. Also not the biggest fan of Jang Hyuk, don\\'t dislike him, just don\\'t love him enough to watch it just for him. this is one of the best kdramas ever... everything is perfect.. jang hyuk should get tropphy for his act.. loving it With Jang Hyuk, I am the least objective fan you can find. Why? Fated to Love You was my very first drama period and than the rest is history. So I’m extremely biased when it comes to JH’s dramas. I tend to watch his dramas twice or more in case I wasn’t objective enough the first time around. In Jang Hyuk last 2 dramas; it seemed like he was mentoring the younger cast more than anything. It is wonderful to witness that with an established actor. Do not be deceived by the low tv ratings, I assure you this is one of the best drama for 2018. All thumbs up to Jang Hyuk for his great acting in Bad Papa. ????????? This is by far the best drama u gonna watch, so touching it is rare for drama to have deep story of each character in it .. and this drama has it .. loved it ..it was not written just for entertain .. it has deep message .. and well done that I even forgot that they were acting .. this drama deserve \"grand prize\\' for all the staff who related to it .. I don\\'t think I\\'ll forget about it for a while .. I love this drama. Jang Hyuk is a best actor. Great story. Good for family. His daughter loves him despite her being mean with him sometimes. Shin Eun Soo is really cute. Dear All, I love this drama si much. Jang Hyuk is the best as always the best drama of the year. I can\\'t take my eyes off while watching this. Jang hyuk, you are a perfect actor. We are never bored nor disappointed as long as you\\'re in the show. Fighting! You are the best. Sarang he Jang Hyuk is fabulous in this as with everything he does. It\\'s sad the script doesn\\'t seem set up in a way that he can win in the end. The character is of a good person who makes poor choices. I somehow hope the writers will salvage his situation, yet I can\\'t see it happening. This drama has potential but it is set up for failure. The ratings are going down because every Monday and Tuesday when you expect it, the KBO is replacing it. The television network is at fault for the horrible programming schedule thats leading to the dropped ratings. I really love this show, but I will wait until it\\'s finished. I can understand why the ratings are going down. They have great cliffhangers but eventually you will fall if you hold on too long! I love Jang Hyuk inbthis dhow. He always looks cheerful in front of his loved ones but his sickening wife makes him lonely. Think many people can identify his helpless love for his family - want to give so much but is limited by his means. I like his daughter for her quiet love for her dad. Hope more people will start watching this show and boost the rating. It’s a touching story Damn missing episodes again. Im big fan of this drama but episodes missing everyweek its so disgusting What happened to all these episodes we keep missing? This is why the ratings keep going down!! You can\\'t take a drama and continuously drop it because something with higher ratings will come on. Well, then you end up losing out on the show. Glad you are making money while making the fans of this show either upset and not watch it, or sad because they love it! Can\\'t stand the wife but i really like the lady cop Are you talking about the kid with the deep voice, he is creeping! To Blunt, I really like the way you explained it. Yes, you are right on, but also you look at the deep root of the problem (pun intended...Deep Root). He is human and had a choice to make, one he really wouldn\\'t have done had his friend not have screwed him over, and that\\'s exactly what he did. He lied and made more than enough to pay him back. This was supposed to be his friend. Like he said, \"at least you seem like a good father\", and that is how he was able to get forgive him in someway, or more or less, get closure. If he didn\\'t make all that money, who knows if he would\\'ve handled it different, but I doubt it because that\\'s the type of man he is. His daughter means everything to him and so he is empathetic with good caring fathers, but not dumb to know he has been burned. I don\\'t know why they made the title Bad Papa? So far he has been nothing but more than decent and humane. Maybe further down he will turn into a bad daddy, MUAH! So far he is the only the medicine has even worked for, but I\\'m nervous about the repercussions of it. Although the story so frustrating, but that\\'s how life is and makes it very unique as it potrays how real life wait. Well he has found out about his wife. Why is Lee Min Woo following Yoo Ji wife? This drama is srly so good!! Love the storyline and brilliant acting by Jang Hyuk! Such a pity to those who missed it. To Blunt You can\\'t expect all heroes to be smart. I like that he is now frustrating because then there would be a lot of room for character development. All characters are flawed, which happens in real life. Not unlike other dramas that would just revolve around love stories with some BS chaebol and damsel in distress sh*t. Very tired of those typical kdrama tropes. Why are policemen always so badly portrayed in K-dramas? It\\'s very frustrating to watch. The so-called \"hero\" in this drama looks as dumb and as uncultivated as the lowlifes he\\'s chasing. No, actually, he looks even dumber than them. This drama is really good tho Eunsoo looklike a bit lim soo hyang here?? There\\'s no love line but apparently his wife will have an affair with his mma rival lol Wow the first 2 episodes were so good! Jang Hyuk as a papa really moved me to tears. Daebak, Jang Hyukssi! first episode and it\\'s already a hit. \\'can\\'t wait for the next episode. I like this kdrama! I ship young-sun either with sang-a or min-woo ^_^ Wherever there\\'s Jang Hyuk, you will not be disappointed. He is an A list star who shines on any roles.. Finally a teaser! I can finally set my calendar. Starting October 1, 2018, my Mondays and Tuesdays will be dedicated again to Hyukie Oppa! I\\'ve missed him being the lead in a drama. I hope the storyline would be as flawless as Money Flower. Jang Hyuk\\'s new drama!! Looking forward to this. Sept comes sooner!! Yes!!!! Can\\'t wait for Jang Hyuk in a new drama and an action one! He is so good in action and acting!! Shin Eun Soo accepted the role niceeeeeeeee be a good daughter to bad papa Jang Hyuk lol There is no love-line. He already has a wife and daughter in the drama. He will work on getting back his family\\'s love. Jaekyung will investigate a drug abuse case in which he is involved. I hope there is a love line between jang hyuk and jaekyung. Plot seems like “Southpaw” movie. Can’t wait!! I hope JYP lets Shin Eun-soo accept this role. Jang Hyuk kejar setoran ne yeee..hehe yes love this oppa jang hyuk your not resting anymore wow fighting lov3 the main actress in unni is alive she is amazing omw does this man ever rest? he\\'d been filming dramas after dramas. Love you oppa! So happy with your role in this drama. It\\'s really written for you.. can\\'t wait to see this drama. Oh yeah, looking forward to seeing Jang Hyuk as a boxer!!',\n",

Whats the car that they drive In the first episode of beauty inside, couldn\\'t the male lead not have been hit by a car if he pushed himself and the female lead out of the way of the car or pulled her to him instead of pushing her away and standing there Me loveee this drama it\\'s was amazing story and i really like the all of ost this drama?????? Loooooveeee this drama so much. I love the chemistry, i love the love line story. It\\'s a simple drama but not make me boring to watch thisss dramaaa❤️❤️❤️ One of the best drama of 2018!!! I didnt expect that it would be so damn amazing:) Hands down to all the cast? Job well done guys ❤ where is ryu a-ram? a.k.a eunho\\'s dongsaeng? This drama deserves more votes. Love this drama ❤ Wowwwww......I really reallllllly love this drama...I love the songs..I love the cast ...So much love from Nigeria❤? this drama is pretty good. i have just ended this drama and i liked it! After a long time, this a drama that gets me hooked again It\\'s a must watch you won\\'t regret it Really really cute! Really cute drama! Interactions between leads and side characters make me all happy and giigly. You should try this drama if you have time. Daebak this drama is so cute i love kang sa ra and ryu eun ho omg. They are sooo cute. Good message. Good acting. Good kiss scene. No chemistry between leads. Chemistry cute between Sara and Eun Ho. But I don\\'t really like Eun Ho personality. He such like a gigolo I gave up in the middle of episode 4. Some parts were cute, and the story was interesting. I just wasn\\'t hooked. I started because of Ahn Jae Hyun, and stayed on because it was actually quite good. I just have to say thank you for stellar! Thanks for the song!:) What a drama, can’t stop replaying the cute scenes with the main leads together even though I had completed watching this drama. It’s really rare to see good chemistry between leads in Korean dramas, the storyline is so-so but thankfully the cast saved this show. Anyone else here kind to recommend good romcom dramas like this with good chemistry between the leads? Beautiful, inspiring! i am not a fan of seo hyunJin and lee minki.BUT, i fell in love with them in this drama. the story plot is typical but the writernim is brilliant in creating characters of such.it may be unrealistic that a person can change form but miraculously i love the premise of the story.the chemistry between them were amazing, plus wonderful OSTs. i would say the best rom-com drama of 2018 I really love this drama, the chemistry between the leads is crazy >//< This drama has such a beautiful message about self love and self acceptance. There were so many beautiful moments and just when you thought there might be a bit of kdrama cliched moments, they transform into something beautiful. Beautiful is the only word I can use to describe this drama. Just beautiful. Love, love love this drama. One of the best for 2018. Really really love the whole story! As in no boring scenes. I\\'ve watched it twice! So love! <3 i love it <3 <3 <3 A surprising find! Didn\\'t really expect much. It was a bit predictable in the start, but great acting, great lines and great values. I love how they emphasize messages like loving your inner beauty and not just the outer shell. Also, that everything has a purpose. bad storyline but good lead chemistry. Aww... I\\'ll miss this drama... It was the only drama ive watched this past few months simce i really couldnt find anything worthwhile. Love the ending although i really thought they willl pair Woo Mi and Joo Hwan. So sad they were kinda cute... But somethings bothering me though.. Is Joo Hwan gay in here???? I cry a lot? at episode 10... Who else? Just Love this drama.Such a beautiful storyline.Each and every single character justified their roles.Even the kinhkang..One of the best dramas of 2018. Best drama I\\'ve watched this year! Seo Hyun Jin is an excellent actress, i feel the pain whenever she cries from Oh Hae young to this drama.. i love the second couple! Lee da hee is very pretty and a good actress too! Casting was perfect. Good job to you all! Seo hyun jin so beautiful in this drama to those who are looking for the eng song, the title is Run by 2morro. And yes I actually went out of my way to listen carefully to the parts when the song was played and searched the lyrics on Google. Apparently, it was sung by 2morro--the one who sang their ost soundtrack part 5 The Love Inside which turned out to be a korean band/singer. Probably explains why lots of people had a hard time looking for it Han Se Kye.... my hero, my sunshine... Seo Hyun-Jin is insufferable in this role. Sometimes I really wondered if she had any gray matter in her skull. I’d have tolerated the plot if it wasn’t her. The last episodes were a pain. Would not recommend. Han Se Kye will be one of my favourite character. I\\'m a bit upset with the ending! Because they didn\\'t even show us who Woo Mi boyfriend is. I feel you Eun Ho ya..:( PERFECT! What an amazing drama!!! It was like a full package. Theres so many touching and funny moments. But there are also heartbreaking moments. The actors portrayed their characters SO well. The pace of the drama was perfect - it didnt feel rushed and it wasn\\'t slow at all. Writers did a great job. The chemistry between the leads were off the roof!!!!! The ending is absolutely beautiful too. It truly made me feel like I will miss every single character. definitely my favourite drama of the year!!! finally the kdrama lords granted me some drama worth waiting for every week Seo Hyun Jin-ssi has to do a movie in 2019...!!! i still can\\'t accept in ep02 when seo do jae trying to open se gye\\'s phone & he successfully opened it. For me it still very rude attitude when you open someone belonging without her permission. We need preview for the next eps??? I have watched the Movie where his is based from and I can say that I love what the writer and the director did on this series! I love the movie but I also love this! I\\'ve watched the movie for a couple of times but the take on this one is so different and having the Woo Jin role return to one form and looks makes it a whole lot different and less heavy. Besides of the story, what I love the most of this drama are: 1. Seo Hyun Jin & Lee Da Hee\\'s fashion style, especially Hyun Jin\\'s Alexander McQueen clothes in episode 13; and 2. KingKang, who wouldn\\'t love that pretty and smart doggy? Ilove seo hyun jin and lee min ke? ihope in real life u will become boyfiend/girlfriend???? Anyone know the english song? Seo hyun jin & lee min ke forever.??? best k drama ever.....love it...saddest episode when han se gye felt guilty because she\\'s the one who makes do jae got accident 10 years ago...can\\'t wait for the next episode .. It\\'s almost ending now, for our century couple who has been through a lot suffer and tears, you two will have each other and life happily now. goooooossssshhhhhh! am i an emotional wreck! especially when it comes to kdramas. the end f episode 14 made me soooooooooo emotional! it was a mixtur of frustration, anger and sadness.i am very relieved to hear that there are more episodes coming out;) I must say, this Kdrama deserves an award!!! It is too great for words. Loving this drama! Seo Hyun-Jin has grown so much as an actress. She really shines in this drama. Great pairing with Lee Min Ki! The secondary stories are as compelling as the main plot which keeps you hanging on from episode to episode. I\\'ll be sad when this drama ends. Seo Hyun Jin\\'s visual and acting make me keep to look at the screen. I hope she won\\'t took too long time for the next project. How about back to movie? an action movie? Just a minor Easter egg, but isn\\'t the movie they went to watch in episode 4 the movie this drama is based on? The best drama ever, seo hyun jin ang lee min ki perfect couple for this year ❤️❤️❤️ Best drama of 2018... kudos to the actors and actress, and the crews. LOVE IT!! I loooooooooooooveeeee this drama!!! Best drama of 2018!!!:D Best drama 2018 so far? Seo Hyun Jin is the best actress,,,I love all of her drama Seo Hyun Jin! you are the reason i watch this drama from beginning to end! Why no one talk about how great Seo Hyun Jin as Se Kye and all actors who play as the changing\\'s Se Kye can harmonize well as one character/person. Anyone know english song that play in ep 12 when eunho drink with sara? I really like Lee Da-Hee\\'s acting in this drama ,also his relationship with Ahn Jae-Hyeon is interesting and funny. That\\'s so amazing.... For me, this drama is best of the year. why I am more interested in relationship between sa-ra and eun-ho? I really love their chemistry ♥♥ @Kimiko I\\'m with you. I watch this drama because I\\'m a big fan of Lee Da Hee since I hear you voice. She is a great actress and I totally in love with her character in this drama. I think sa ra\\'s character suit her the most. I\\'m so glad she get more fans. Fightinggg Lee Da Hee! I cried twice while watching through episode 1 to 10 for this drama... 1st when they confessed their love on the hospital roof... the 2nd part that made my tears stream down like broken dam is when omma passed away... that part really hits me hard... to all mom in the world especially my mom... I love you omma... please stay healthy forever...;( and be with us forever... is it just me or is ahn jae hyun getting much better at acting? i think he is one of those actors that suit supporting roles... like kang ki young\\ufeff I just watched episode 10, and it really made me cry. This is the best episode that i’ve watched so far. There’s romance, comedy and drama in this episode that i’ve really enjoyed. As early as now, let us show how we love our moms, dads and family members before it’s too late.:) Does someone know that the song was at the end part in episode 3? when Seo Do-Jae sees Han Se-Kye at that airport thing. I love everything about this drama. The chemistry between the main leads, the friendship betweeen segye eunho and woomi, the relationship between kang sara and eunho. And kingkang! I also love those actors who play as segye. They’re great! The acting is superb. Love this drama. Very good storyY!!! Every episode was amazing. The chemistry between LMK and SHJ was amazing too. Episode 10 makes me cry a lot Huhuhuhu. kingkang so cuuute I love this drama very much!! ❤❤ The story gets really interesting as it progresses!! Plus the osts are really good specially the one with Wendy and Kwill. The trailer for ep 9 is killing me!!!!! ❤️ Love it when han se gye transform to kim min suk. It\\'s a reunion with lee min ki. They both was in because its my first life and shut up flower boyband. Love it! When lee min ki smirk. Kyaaaaaaaaa >.< I love the quirkiness in this drama, especially when Se Gye transforms into someone else. Anyone know what is the title of bgm english song that play in episode8? I\\'m very addicted to Lee Min Ki\\'s acting. The story is so interesting and funny. All of people in this drama is so good in acting and suitable.? now that i\\'ve watched up to episode 6, i think the show is hitting its stride. Each new transformation brings something new, charming and comedic to the table so even though the main couple are together now, i\\'m not afraid of the plot getting stale. Han Se Kye, I cannot stop looking at her. I\\'ve seen her few dramas before, but I don\\'t know why but she\\'s an angel here ❣️ O.M.G. Can\\'t describe how much I love this drama. It\\'s been a long time since I last watch a Korean drama that is currently on air, I usually wait for the drama to end before watching it on marathon. But this drama just got me hooked!! Let\\'s see if this drama can get into my list of must-repeat-watching. i really love this drama as much as i love the movie version. Ahn Jae-Hyeon and Lee Min Ki are two of my top fave actors. I originally watch it because of them but deym that story is soooo good. Lee min ki is a good choice playing this kind of role, just like in \"bcs this is my first life\" drama, the same cold inflexible character, hyun jin is also good choice as a laid back but stern character, and im excited about this drama, especially after the great movie, however after seeing the early eps (2 is enough for me) I\\'m dropping this one. Idk, maybe im too overexpect things but i feel this drama wasted a good source material and only pick up the \"changing appearance\" factor only. I dont see chemistry among minki and hyun jin even though usually in dramas the main pair always bickering and be together in the end, no clear story, forced plot, too many meh jokes and cheap slapstick, i just think the movie deserves better adaptation. Im actually onboarded on this drama for Lee Da Hee. She may not be the lead on this drama but she\\'s definitely killin it. I swear she really suites this type of roles. I also like that they made her character not so evil and very likable. The chemistry between the leads is sooo damn fine even when Han Se Gye portrayed by Kim Min Seok, i still got the chemistry. And honestly it\\'s kinda trigger my fujo side hahaha. It\\'s just because Seo Hyun Jin and Lee Min Ki build the chemistry perfectly, and the support actors that portrayed any kind of Han Se Gye delivered the act so good, too. i\\'m in love with this drama!!!! Omggg why so cute, funny and make me \"aaaw\" every time Seo Do Jae with Han Se Gye togetherrrr ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ Seo Hyun Jin is sooo pretty? love her so much! And Lee Da Hee yassss so hot omgosh. Not forget to mention how handsome Lee Min Ki is:\\'( his taking shower scenes? It’s really good drama actually I am Korean drama crazy but this drama i didn’t watch it because of actor I don’t like him but when I watched short video it’s quite nice so I watched it released episodes all day night. So now I’m waiting for new ep so excited to see again.?? only reason ti warch this drama is LEE tae ri.......so freakin cute Lee Da-hee in this series looks damn hot. Seriously, this drama driven me crazy, i just love Lee min Ki and Seo Hyun jin chemistry and thought they already in love as person (not as their character). Everything from Lee Min Kee and Seo Hyun Jin is amazing. They are one of the best in K-Drama. I guess, good or bad script they will no doubt pull it through and make it happen. This drama had an interesting start and keeps on getting better every on going episode. I really don\\'t agree to negative comments. I LOVE, enjoy and will support till the very end! I haven\\'t watch the movie. But reading all the negative comments from the people that already watched the movie, I don\\'t think i\\'m going to. Personally i think this is a great movie. Just don\\'t compare it to the movie. For me who haven\\'t watch the movie, this is an excellent drama. Nooo flower I disagree it is is really a good drama ... It has a bit natural thing but obviously it has to be different from the movie it should be why to watch the same thing again ... And I came Because of Ahn Jae Hyun .. please do support them ... I haven\\'t seen till the latest episodes but it is quite nice though they should show a good bonding of lead coactor and actress that\\'s what u want I guess ... Good drama overall ... Currently at ep4. And for me, its kind of disappointment a bit ...Movie of this drama, wrap up very nice, sad and amazing plus impress me. I expect this drama will amaze me too, but sadly.. Up to episode 3 its getting bored and lots of times wasted over flashback memory, playing hard to get, and again lee min ki deal with contract \\'love\\' partner.. I watched this drama bc of lee min ki and ahn jae hyun,.. The plot is totally different from the movie, and i think..... I don\\'t really like this drama plot. I don\\'t think i am going to watch next episode, may be i wait till all episode done,then i skip to final ep, just to see how they wrap up. We have different type of taste as a viewer, don\\'t mind my comment, i just point out my opinion. For me, its doesn\\'t impressed me much, doesn\\'t worth my time. Yay this is to much JTBC.....ep 1 is captivating for me already.....I\\'ll wait every week to be aired....Aja!!!... Min-ki never fail to make me smile like an idiot in every character he played. And I think Hyun Jin is getting prettier and more charismatic compare to ger previous dramas. ❤️ The beauty inside goal!! Minki & hyunjin so perfect!! ❤️❤️ Im sooooooo into this drama right now. The leads are match made in heaven and the drama is light, funny, touching and captivating all at the same time. I regret watching this when it’s still on-going. I’ll go crazy having to wait week by week.. I think I\\'m going crazy for this one ♥♥♥♥ Anyone who knows the title of the english song that was played in episode 1 when se gye was running away during the awards ceremony scene??? @cb yes yes! same director of Another Miss Oh, that\\'s the reason behind the same vibes it gives, just like Another Miss Oh. What\\'s the name of the song at beginning There we go a season where every drama in all channels are really good. I dont know which one to watch first. I can barely sleep if i binge watch it ㄴㄴㄴㄴㄴㄴㄴ hyun jin so beautiful I love this drama The beauty inside wow perfect chemistry with Min Ki Great drama I hope that ahn jae hyeon\\'s wife would have an appearance in this drama because hyun jin and his wife are close friends. Also, why Ahn jae hyeon always looks young? He still looks like a 28 year old tho Why on earth does Ahn Jae Hyun still give off that vibe of being like 19 when he\\'s bloody 31 in this drama. His young looks always confuses me lol is it just me or Hyunjin sometimes looks like Jessica Jung at some angles? is this drama have the same director or cameramen with Another Miss Oh drama? cause I feel like it is Hope to see Han Hyo Joo cameo on this drama The male lead acting so flat I hate to say some actor looks like another since its so frequent in asian coutries, but I can\\'t pass without saying it: Min ki looks like park hae jin\\'s double. terrific ressemblance! Hyun jin eonnie?? I hope Han Hyo Joo cameo on this!! Ahn Jae hyun!!!! i can\\'t wait to see in this drama!!! I like Lee Da-Hee Lee minki oppa ❤❤ finally can meet you again every week.. yayy.. plus seo hyunjin soo pretty in this drama. She get the aura and charisma already.. beauty inside fighting.. ❤❤❤ I think I\\'ll be back on kdramaland just to watch this and TVN\\'s Boyfriend. Lee Min Kiiiiiiii!!!!! Don\\'t die anymooorrrree hahahaha Im excited for thisL?Lee Min-Ki! Lee Min-Ki, Lee Min-Ki, Lee Min-Ki! <3 Ahn jae hyun is super handsome!! Why he has to be the second lead?? I love him so much Did anyone noticed little cute dog\\'s reaction while watching TV in a new teaser?????? Waiting to watch Seo Hyun Jin in this drama ❤❤❤❤ Looking forward to this drama. Okay so The director, and the Actors are already boom. Like I can\\'t wait for october to be here. I was crying due to boredom. Seriously, the dramas that are on now are so lacklastor. So When I saw the combination of this show let alone the story itself, it was salvation for a drama watcher like myself. So to say i\\'m beyond anxious for this show is an underestimate. i really love the movie version, i hope the drama is also good Seo Hyun Jin soo stunning on poster .... wow... hwaiting Seo Hyunjin ❤️ so pretty woman. Ohhyuk voice❤️❤️❤️ Hope there will be some interesting cameo appearance to be looking forward! Please let it be Lee minki and seo hyunjin looks good together.. cant wait.. i\\'m highly anticipating this! Finally reading script picture release. Hope it will be a hit!! ❤ Uwaaaaaa Seo Hyun jin and Lee Min ki >.< min ki will have a lead role!!!! i really miss him after BTIMFL .... i wish jung min will appear just for cameo I really liked the movie, hopefully the drama will be just as good, the cast is full of talented and experienced actors, now i just have to wait and see if the plot is good too. Ryu Hwa Young joined this drama!!! Yippieee~~ I\\'m so anticipate every her drama. Chae Yoori is such different character again after Rayoung,Yina and Hari last year:DD Seo Hyun Jin unnie i cheer you...!!! AJH??? Is he gonna played in this drama? I just came here because of him. I love AJH so much. Everyone, the main actress is Seo Hyun Jin. The plot says that her appearance changes and have the same appearance for 1 week. Which means that after one week, she will go back to her original physical appearance. Unlike the movie that the character never had the same face twice. Anticipating this show big time! Lee Min Ki is just wow. Every role he played were all fantastic! Plus the fact that the movie version of this drama is a very great one too. The Beauty Inside fighting! If she changes everytime then how come there is a main actress? Dont get me wrong i love seo hyun jin thats why im asking this actually because it will be dissapointing to wait for this drama and find out im gonna only see her for a week or two. Why am I not surprised... I was looking forward to this one aahh, .she changes every month .. maybe the plot will focus on that 1 month, when he becomes hyunjin,. yeayy,,minki will act in the drama again,. usually he takes a long break before comeback to drama again,.i thought the woman will be changes every day, so why they must had a lead female? Seo Hyun Jin and Ahn Jae Hyun is best friend in real life (actually Seo Hyun Jin and Goo Hye Sun are the bestie) then they gonna meet in this drama as best friend as well? couldn\\'t explain how excited me...fighting for all the cast! Blue ssi read properly. One week every month not everyday why is the actress casted?? if she is going to be changing faces everyday, wouldnt there be a series of cameos?? This would require many cameo appearances for every change in appearance. Whoa!!!! I\\'m excited!!!! Lee min ki Seo Hyun-Jin is my favourite Kdrama actress. I will watch her in anything. Looking forward to this. I would love to see Lee Min Ki as the first lead! Please accept <3 I can imagine how gorgeous AJH would be as the priest!! He has those calm and mysterious vibes that will perfectly suit to his role. AJH fighting!!!! I want Ahn Jae Hyun to take the role as a priest!! Lee Min Ki please accept??? Then lee min ki will remake han hyo joo\\'s roll , so seo hyun jin take one of Woo-jin transportation? It\\'s will need more actor and actress oh my i hope some popular artist will take this project....I will unlimitedly waiting for this... BIG YES to Seo Hyun Jin and Lee Min Ki ❤❤❤ Seo Hyun Jin please accept <3',\n",

       "  'comments': '10 mins. ago.. i\\'m done watching this. i watch it because i really idolize Park Sung Wong (Yoo Jin Geuk) This drama was the best drama I have seen in a very long time that not only made me fall in love with it, but also cry tears for days. It\\'s truly the Romeo and Juliet story of this generation and the tragedy makes it so much more memorable and touching. If you loved seeing Werewolf boy the Korean film then this is the drama for you. Olus the actors all deserve awards because they really nail their characters and it\\'s a complete new look into how beautifully diverse Seo In guk is as an actor! I\\'m very proud of this drama and I would 100% recommend it! Different, it catches you. This drama keeps pulling you in, makes you want to know the plot more and more. strong drama ... strong acting ... strong story ... love it I\\'ve watched a handful of dramas, but this one is the first I did not enjoy. First 8 ep are fine and paced well, after that it goes downhill. I don\\'t understand why many of you said its kinda dragging but for me its not, because curiousity keeps me wanting to watch it nonstop. In the first episode i was so confused and moo young character keeps me attached. I mean i want to know more about him. Then the plot twist was so disturbing i can\\'t explain. And the ending:( . But overall its so so nice! A must watch! 8/10! Its so dragging.... so many backflash scene. Thats why i didnt like the main lead actress.. Her movies always like that. seo in guk perform well that i hate him so much his face was definitely arrogant face so disgusting when women fall for him and like a hooker attach to him. The 2main lead were good in acting they so good but don\\'t like the dragging and backscene. It could finish in 10episod. Shit, got attached just because i was curious and watched the first ep. And became addicted. Too depressed because while i know this is a tragedy drama and guess a sad ending, but still have tiny hope that the finale would be a happily ever after. I even stucked for about an hour after i watched the finale, searching \"the smile has left your eyes alternate ending\". In hope i could get the ending i want kkkk. Cried a lot huhu. Great chemistry. i\\'m actually closing 2018 with this tragic drama, one of the best dramas i\\'ve ever watched, proof;i just spent the last 1h30 crying.what\\'s more tragic is knowing that if he killed her for nothing, the fact that she was actually lying. A melodrama hit! Reminds me of The Innocent Man with Song Joong Ki but with more sweet and happier moments. amzaing loved the story and the difrent from jap orignal is so much diferent and loved the casting Closing this 2018 with this drama with tears in my eyes. Emotionally engaged since first episodes. Perfect casts perfect plot. Good job for making me cry Best Kdrama I have watched so far:( I cried a lot. See in Guk...phenomenal in this show!!! Jung so Min was good too but I thought Seo In Guk did the best performance I have ever seen in a k-drama...and I have watched A LOT of k-dramas! I\\'ve really enjoyed this drama, one of the best actually. Love the chemistry of the 2 lead ❤ I am having withdrawal symptoms from this drama. I cannot move on from this drama . Wanted to watch again after i finish watching yesterday wtf haha this drama wow its really one of those drama that are very different from dramas nowadays all cliche and happy romance. I freaking love this drama so much, this drama is so beautiful and sad at the same time. I watched more than half of the drama and I came here to read the reviews wow when I read that it\\'ll be a sad ending wow my heart literally dropped. Kinda expected it but wow wanted to drop this drama cos I can\\'t see my Moo Young and Jin Kang not end up happily ever after:( But the drama is so good I cannot stop myself from watching it. Although MY is not a good person but my lil heart breaks for him and I just wanna say Im still angry that JK reject eating cake w MY like its his bday cmon my lil boy was so sad:( Seo in guk and Jung So Min have the perfect chemistry on this drama, loved every episode! Their last dramas weren\\'t nearly as enjoyable, as this one. Well done! This is one of those korean series that we have wasted our time with. Mr. Sunshine is way better than this. Apologies to the main leads as I have watched their previous dramas and they we’re so good but the plot of this one is so dragging...It’s my honest opinion especially for those who are use to really good dramas and read comments in asianwiki before watching one. I thought this is so great as I have reviewed a lot of comments here. I don’t know where to begin... Great plot great story great acting none is no great. Must watch and rewatch. Congrats to all the team. Everything is so awesome!!! I have never commented on this site once. But this show was so beautiful as it was sad. i loved every moment of this show. i would recommend. Best drama 2018 ❤❤❤ best actor and best actress 2018.. Seo in guk & jung so min jjang! Love you ❤ Great plot, acting.....og i loe seo in guk and jung so min they portrayed so well...thumbs up...although the end like that i appreciate it (well i want this a happy ending too) .coz it portrays the real world ...we cannot get all that we want.... life is myteriuos ways take it or leave it The ratings should have been way higher in Korea but oh well us international fans love this drama. It\\'s so well acted and written and adapted from the Japanese version into it\\'s own Korean amazing flare. Every second I was invested thanks to the entire cast but I have to admit Seo In Guk stole the show with his intense eyes and terrific acting. He is so diverse and his skills are impeccable! If you love a great suspense Romantic drama that low key reminds me of Shakespeare then you have to witness this masterpiece. SPOILER ALERT best melodrama i watched so far we should nominate Seo In-Guk and Jung So-Min for the best actor / actress. the best drama in 2018 too. love it!!! Back again. This time having finished all episodes. This drama is best drama in 2018.. Cast, story, direction everything is perfect.. SeoInGuk & JungSoMin both chemistry o my god so real.. I am addicted this drama ❤❤❤❤❤?????????? This was the best drama of all time. Dont @ me on this. Best main actor, best female actress, best side actors, best acting, best storyline. I cried so much and felt so many emotions. It really touched my heart and ticks all my boxes. I love everything about it and i really really really hope i find another drama exactly like it. The love seems so pure yet the story is so toxic. There are so many twists and turns but thats why i love it so muchm it definitely is the best drama i ahve ever watched and believe me ive watched a lot. Although other dramas were amazing too, this was the only drama that fully satisfied me and for that i am i grateful. Why do you think this drama was named “ hundred million stars fall from the sky”? I just want to know the meaning of this tittle. Why do they decided that this title suit this drama? Best drama . Best actor Seo In Guk , Best actress Jung So Min Aahhhhhh!! People were like this is the best drama and all...I shouldn\\'t have trusted the comments ..waited for this drama to get over and read your comments so that I could watch it...!! Dude I thought it had an happy ending!! Like why?? Ending Would have been good if he went to jail and she waits for him..!! Aahhh.. it would have been the best drama of my list had I not seen the ending. !! And this makes the first tragic k drama I have seen.....!!Shoot!! I have always been so careful in choosing k dramas...nd this happnd!! Well then it suits the titles.. I cried like a river. Deserve an award esp to SIG for Best Actor and So-min for Best Actress?? My best kdrama 2018 chemistry on point. The acting was phenomenal. This is one of the best. The love and chemistry are flawless and the story is filled with raw moments of suspense, shock, quiet, passion, and heartbreak. It is beautiful. Standing ovation!!! Hands down the best Kdrama!!! So well written and the two main leads deserve an award...so outstanding the both of them along with the entire cast! Was on the edge of my seat till the very end! Will miss this excellent drama! Highly highly recommend! No wordsto describe such a fantabulous drama! Cried a river at the end but it was worth it. I hope this drama and the actors receive the recognition they deserve. Hwaiting! this is way too good??? i really recommend you all to watch it I love Jang Seran:D Another sad ending drama with perfect chemistry between SIG and JSM. I placed it in number 3 of sad ending drama list beside Scarlet Heart Ryeo and Mr Sunshine. They kept on killing effective roles (Seung Ah, Woo Sang, Se Ran). The chemistry is not so great compared to JSM and Lee Min Ki in BTIMFL. Good scripting though, and the best part is the ending!? I just finished watching the final episode of this intense, complex and excellent psychological drama. This drama deals with the different ways human beings of different ages deal with traumas that have profoundly shaped their entire lives. The story builds upon a powerfully traumatic combination of events that occurred 25 years ago, but which we do not know in any detail. . At the center of the drama are three major characters. This drama deserves so many awards! It\\'s absolutely captivating and mysterious from beginning to end. Seo in Guk is phenomenal actor, and I couldn\\'t think of someone else to play the role. He was mysterious yet warm, calculating yet caring, and Jung So Min played a phenomenal balance to Seo in Guk\\'s character, and I want to see them in more dramas together. Overall a well written, well acted drama and the cinematography was stunning! Love, love, love, love it! One of the best k-dramas I\\'ve watched so far. Both Jung So Min and See In Guk portrayed their character so well. The ending was not the way I wanted it to end, but I\\'m still pretty satisfied. Thumps up to all the cast! deserves an award.. jung so min and seo in guk ,their chemistry is great! hope to see them in another project??? no more words just \"wow\"!!!! The drama is masterpiece!! I had finish watching the drama. I never so interest like this to film or drama. The best korean drama i’ve ever watched!! The drama contain melodrama, thriller, mystery, and romance at the same time. Maybe i sound exaggerating but you will feel the same after watching this drama. The actors and the actress did really perfect job (especially the main actor Seo In Guk and the main actres Jung So Min). The chesmistry between every actors and actress like real. When i watching this drama i almost forgot i was watching a drama, not a reality. The background music, the original sound track also perfect!! I just speechless. Never been into to it to drama. All every aspect to this drama should win award!!! Amazing drama. This is one of the best drama I have ever watched. I like Seo In Gook before, and because this drama i\\'ve fallen so deeply in love with him. Tragic The ending of the Korean version is fortunately not as tragic as the Japanese version. The Koreans are more optimistic in a way and used the theme of the “power of love” to heal all of them. They gave the plot a different twist in the final episodes. They have already given the viewers a glimpse of this twist in episode 15. Can’t wait to watch episode 16 to find out the resolution. Thumbs up for SIG, JSM, and all the actors and crew! Happy ending please!!!! Don\\'t follow the japanese version for the ending.. I\\'m begging you. Seo in Guk is an amazing actor. I’m watching 38 task force and this one. I really love seo in guk ive fallen deeply in love with hin in this drama youve done a masterpiece... I have fallen so deeply in love with this drama. This is the only drama I watch now, since all other ongoing dramas now are nowhere as good as this one. Even though the plot is very much the same as the Japanese version, this rendition is sooo brilliantly done. Even scene, especially ones between SIG and JSM are so well done! I have fallen in love with Seo In Guk as an actor through this drama. This is definitely one of the best TvN dramas I have ever watched! The chemistry between the characters are so intense. I am also happy that this drama follows it\\'s original plot instead of forcing a happy ending. It will be the most mesmerizing going the tragic way. It started off well for me then it just went pear shaped between ep 6-8. This one is not for me, which is a shame cause I am sucker for psychological thrillers. I think jin Kang is the other couple kid ... well hoping for this to happen?? I love the story, although I pitied all the main characters. I love their chemistry. I hope the writers will make it a happy ending. Please. awesome show.. Excellent drama. Everyone acting so well. Especially seo in guk n jung so min so natural a couple makes you feel alot for them. This drama is a gem amongst others airing right now. I love it to bits and pieces. Skorea often sleeps on good drama, usually its more hyped internationally, like this for example. The chemistry between the main leads is very strong, you’ll never get enough of the both of them. (so min acting is so good sometimes i forgot she’s dating irl lmao can they two just date) I think I don\\'t want to watch the rest of episodes because its the same ending with japanese version. Although this is so beautiful drama with strong chemistry between the main casts. I love MoonKang couple. And so sad this drama didnt get higher ratings maybe because the audience already knew the plot and the ending of this drama. Wow... They have partner, but the chemistry so amazing! Why this drama so underrated. This is an amazing drama. You should watch it first. Fighting minguk oppa, somin uniie ❤❤❤ I know you\\'ll be my home someday... Very intellectually done amazing acting of Seo In guk charming.. His character is mysterous and charismatically dangerous yet behind his stiff and strong character is hiding the astray soul, finding a way to pull out himself to the tragic event that happened in his life during his childhood. Memories that was forgotton to be able to participate in the present world, his hiden pain that looses its course in every firm decision he makes even it causes his life to stand up for he believe is right for him. Amazing drama... It is such a wonderful drama, each episode just make me thinking a lot, and I just try to find a japanese one. I found that In guk and So min make it good?. A good twist I\\'ve ever think Oh my god I love no I live for this drama I use to have a favourite drama same one for years then this drama came and oh my god ain’t it kicked my old favourite out the picture!!!!!! We already know I’m gonna be heart broken when this finishes?? May or may not have watched all episodes four times each........ who do I need to email to make carry on?? As in like make more episodes I need more than 16 or Infact I need a season 2:) I usually only write these messages when I am done with a drama but... I am too anxious to just sit by and wait 5 days until another episode... I love this drama, this is exactly the kind of genre, story, pace of a drama that I like... and it is not easy to predict what will happen next... I love the chemistry between seo in guk and Jung min it is just lovely. And seo in guk is just... aghhhhh he is so hot I can not.. I am jealous of a fictive couple lol xD This is probably one of the best Korean dramas I have ever seen. Every aspect of this drama series was done so well -- from the screenplay, to the storyline, the actors, the cinematography, the soundtrack, the direction, the execution, etc. It moves and affects you in a slow, quiet way. It is not loud nor hysterical yet you can feel the emotions in each scene. kim moo young and those sad puppy dog eyes.... can\\'t help but fall in love.... I like SIG. I like JSM. And I like this drama so much. I cried when Kim Moo young said \"Then teach me\". I can feel his loneliness which make me want to hug him? This drama is so f*ckin lit. I find Seo In Guk character mysterious and sexy. You know what i mean? This drama is so good. I highly recommend it. its funny cause usually I hate mystery/murder/detective stuff but this was amazing. I love the actors so much. they each played their role so well that I became immersed each second! I haven\\'t watched the Japanese version so I have no preconceived ideas but after his I might watch the Jap version too. but I hate having to wait every week:( My guess about the plot twist. This may contain SPOILER to those who just started the drama!!! I’ve come to a point where I don’t like mystery/thriller/heavy dramas anymore because it only makes me anxious, upset, and afraid of the outcome. And so I only watch light romantic comedy dramas now which will make the viewers happy, in love and relaxed. Loovee this drama.. I can\\'t wait to see if SIG is the bad guy / good guy... honestly I\\'m totally in love with the vibe that this drama brought . it\\'s kind of slow paced but seems very romantic and mystery . hahahhah . i can\\'t explain it well , see it fr urself and you\\'ll know . honestly , every scene involving seo in gook and jung so min , I\\'ll get butterfly in my stomach . hahahahah . Definitely one of the best dramas I\\'ve ever seen. Would recommend it to guys or girls. i hope they won\\'t follow the japanese version\\'s ending. please This drama is amazing. I don\\'t know why korean sleeping on it. I love this genre and still wonder with the plot since it is very unexpected and interesting. Best Remake Ever!!! A Korean Drama but still got a little Japanese vibe on it. The plot are amazing. A drama that make you want to watch over and over and over and over again... Love It! Wow nice drama.... thank you...! God bless...! How come this drama is not more popular?? This is so awesome, definitely up there so far, with my top favorite dramas!! Not to mention my favorite genre! Sooo..like every episode I think I know what\\'s happening then I don\\'t. Like I don\\'t understand what moo young is planning and why and how jinkang and they brother fit in. I wanna watch the original and see how it plays out but I like each week\\'s surprise. I hope SeungAh makes it through the crash though...I don\\'t really like her but still... I\\'m shy so i do\\'nt leave comments at all but thiis drama. Damn I really don\\'t want to spoil myself and barely stopping my curiosity from searching the original story of this. Seo In Guk and Jung So Min chemistryyy is so freaking high level! Why is Korea sleeping on this brilliant drama???? Ugh. OMG! The last time I felt this thrilled was when I watched Prison Break season 1 - and that\\'s my all time favorite American series (except for Friends)... This heart pounding feeling of needing to know if he\\'s really bad or good! Gosh Seo In-Guk at his finest! \"the eyes\"!!! He is surely the perfect person to portray Moo Young though I am fervently hoping that he\\'s not a bad guy! Oh my god....... alright I wanna start off with the fact I ain’t seen the Japanese version so..... but oh my god this drama has knocked my 6 year long favourite drama out the picture and has taken its place!! I kid you not I have watched the last six episodes three times each!!! Like I hear it’s got a sad ending I’m hoping if it’s sad it’s not to sad and they make a season 2 I mean that would just be brilliant I know I’m gonna cry me heart out once seen all 16 but that’s not the point I want more than 16 episodes more!!! I need more!!! Binged watch this now going to start episode 6 but want to say this drama is just thrilling and Jung SoMin and Seo In Guk were cast correctly and are simply outstanding in fact the entire drama from writing, directing, and supporting cast makes it flawless. Didn’t see the J version so am watching this with fresh eyes and an open mind. TvN have another winner on their hands regardless of how the ratings fare over in SK. Watching this drama ..I can see why they cast seo in guk..I watch mostly all of his drama but this one seriously for every episode giving me goosebumps .. his eyes especially..I just hope they end this drama well.. at least for the main lead.. they look good together on screen ..jin kang and moo young fighting Love Moo Young and Yoo Jin...please let them be a couple and happy ending, hoping its different version than japan version. I can\\'t wait for next epi, Although i have watched only one drama of seo in guk yet he never disappoints with his acting. First time seeing me dark and mysterious. How can a cute boy act so good. Never expected this from him. The drama is very good and mysterious. Hoping for the best. The drama was soo good and exciting.. Seo in guk is realy good in acting.. Oh my god! I love this drama. My curiousity is killing me. I hope in the end .. They come up with happy ending... I can\\'t wait for the next episode it\\'s soooooooo good!!! I love this drama so much! I find it worth watching and interesting it makes you ask a lot of questions! fighting!! I\\'ve been waiting for Seo In-Guk\\'s comeback but I\\'m really disappointed because I love him more in a romcom genre. I already felt disappointed in the beginning. Does he really need to have an overly steamy kissing scene with a woman who\\'s not even the female lead. It will ruin his chemistry with the female lead. my favorite actors in one drama but I hate sad endings:/ How can i wait for a week for next episodes? I love everything about this drama! I love seo in guk’s eyes omg. Like everyone i also watched the japan version but only last episodes and i kinda have mixed feelings because i can’t imagine how is it going to be adapted. I make sure to watch it til the end because i’m curious. @moumou, that\\'s because people have different opinions and better learn to respect differences instead of generalizing or criticizing.:-* Oh my god! I went to see the Japanese version\\'s out of curiosity and BOOM, it is sad as hell! oh please don\\'t make the same ending for this version too! It will be a very disappointing and tragic moment. Don\\'t know what people are loving in this drama. The main character is unbearable. I love nothing about this drama. I stopped watching it. Good drama!!! I\\'m so amazed with the acting of Seo In Guk <3 and i hope the ending will be different from the original, i want a happy ending for them:\")) can\\'t wait for the next episode tommorow I heard that it will be sad ending but hoping this drama will be happy ending and I really want to see Seo In guk and Jong so min romantic moment, love this couple I recently watched the japanese version and it was too good. The leads chemistry was beautiful and ending was brilliant considering plot twist??. I think korean version will follow same story just like scarlet heart. One word can describe my impression toward this drama. Amazing!!!!! The next episode comes out tmrw and I’m so excited so far these past two eps have been similar to the jdrama but I’m hoping they change the ending!! Seo In Guk so. im falling in love again. Acting so good and cold vibe. Daebak! wow the 2 episodes got me curious as hell and ugh seo in guk looks amazing in this drama shdgskgdkj i fell in love with the drama by watching its 1st & 2nd eps, then i hunted the Japan version out of curiosity. the original version is undoubtedly lit! though my interest in this story began with Seo In Guk & Jung So Min Chemistry, but i\\'ve to admit that Ryo & Yuko (Japan version) Chemistry is something you\\'ll never forget once you watch it....... This remake is very Captain Obvious. Huge spoiler in the press conference, then more spoilers in episode 2. Pretty disappointing, and the acting feels flat, especially now that they\\'re playing the Moo-young character straight. I didn\\'t see any chemistry between the leads either. Seo In-guk does a lot of that squinty eyes thing like a thwarted child, makes it hard to take him seriously. Wowwww This drama is soooo interesting, Jung so min and Seo in guk Roles Are really perfect for this Drama.Their Acting making it more Thrilling. Park sung woong also Cool. The first 2 episodes is giving me a goosebumb, I dont know why but I have a bad feeling about the ending:( I really ship them, they match each other *teehee* @Caty Seo InGuk acting soo incredible! He has mysterious aura with only his eyes. His acting was undeniable! Really doesn\\'t disappointed Jun So-Min( Mischievous Kiss) and Seo In-Guk (monster also amazing). I know this will show will be one of top 10 kdramas for this year. I’m HOOKED after two episodes...love the suspense, mystery just EVERYTHING about this drama. The actors are all phenomenal. Seo In Guk plays his part perfectly so intrigued by him. Not to mention the beautiful & talented Jung So Min. Can’t wait for the episodes!!! WOW the ending OST tho.. Yellow by Coldplay which recently became famous all over again because of the movie Crazy Rich Asians. Interesting choice. The original version of male lead was being played by takuya kimura who is known to be brilliant actor, so i really have high expectation about seo in guk acting, i haven\\'t watched it but can someone give me honest review? I don\\'t wanna be disappointed Hope this drama is good:) one of my fave actor is in it My fav actor sep in guk is back. Yay!! But please pit on some weight. Really skinny here. Excited to watch his drama after one year...????? Although my fav.actor seo in guk is here but the Japanese version was a very sad ending I regretted watching the drama I hope they don\\'t follow the same plot plzz First episode was huge disappointment for me. Japanese version is darker and more interesting. Seo In-Guk isn\\'t charismatic at all. I love this drama esp seo in guk. Seo in guk is really manly. Look so cool.?❤ I dont really understand how those 2 leads to be together..moo young and seung a become a couple in the first episode..if moo young and jin kang made a new couple..i hate them because jin kang will look like a boyfriend stealer and moo young a pervert and non loyal lover..anyway..just the first ep..i shouldnt make my own conclusion too early Seo in guk really cool here. I don\\'t know why his vibe is different from previous drama. He looks more like a mature person I found that his voice is different. Watched the first episode and it seemed a lot less darker than the japanese version. I\\'m fearing this will be just another makjang without the depressing and dark tones of the original japanese drama. Oooh, I\\'ve watched the original Japanese version. It was a beautiful drama acted by a truly charismatic anti-hero. I really hope the Korean one keeps to it\\'s dark theme. I feel Seo In Gook can carry that out with his gorgeous brooding look. Can\\'t wait to see Jellyfish artist omg Seo In-Guk, Jung Somin special to my bias VIXX\\'s Lee Hongbin? Jelpi stan here?!? So excited for it??? ,,Seo In-Guk is fainally back?? Why does the third trailer look like a perfume add? Lol Holy, this looks so freakin good. Teaser #6 really caught my eye. There is literally no role Seo In-Guk can\\'t do, he seems perfect for this role. Jung So-Min is so gorgeous and it\\'s great to see her venturing out of her usual roles and taking on something like this. I can\\'t wait for this!!! I will watch it for sure. And I don\\'t know if this korean version will keep the dark theme, considering it\\'s a drama. Let\\'s see how it turns out. Reasons y Kdrama Lovers Must Watch This...??? Lov both leads but I remember that in the japanese version there wasn\\'t a happy ending so I haven\\'t decided yet if I should watch it or not:/ Every time I see In Guk, I always see Sungjae and vice versa. Hope they\\'d play in a drama as brothers. It\\'d be awesome Watched the Japanese version because of Takuya Kimura with his killer charisma. It was a beautiful sad drama. I rarely watch sad drama because I don\\'t want to torture my own feelings:D Miss you Mr.Seo In Guk....? Welcome back!! Ooh I love both leads and both second leads... The second leads are both super solid and versatile so I am excited...and it is tvN, so of course they got a massively gifted set of stars! I was excited before but now that it is only 3.5 weeks away I am just plain giddy! That said, how many times must we change out our bookmarks because of this silly nonsense with literal and English titles differing so much? Dear Judge-Dear Honor, Hundred Million Stars-Smile Has Left Your Eyes, the upcoming Yeo Jin Goo show, Prison Playbook-Wise Prison Life etc... I keep thinking a(nother) new drama/movie has been lined up for this or that star but it just ends up being more stuff to uncluttered from my browser. a japanese story and korean production, cant ask for more Have seen the ending of japanese version. It was more than 10 years ago, so the ending can be considered really dark around that time. I don\\'t know about now. And I don\\'t know if this korean version will keep the dark theme, considering it\\'s a drama. Let\\'s see how it turns out. I wonder if the writer will keep the original ending. It\\'ll definitely be interesting but if she changes it I will understand why. The leads are my favorites. I can\\'t wait for this serial drama! Super excited for this..I love Seo In Guk in Shopping King Louis and Ive been a So Min fan since playful Kiss days to father is strange and Because This Is My First Life and of Park Sung Woong..I just finished Life On Mars a week ago??.Sept. 26 come faster???? Just like everyone I am super excited. Dramas from tvN never dissapoint. They are always good. Almost everyone is mentioning Seo In-Guk, Jung So-Min and Hong-Bin. I do like the cast and I agree that they are all amazing actors, but I am more looking forward to Park Sung-Woong (He is as old as my parents) because all the dramas and movies he is in are superb.I just finished Life on Mars with him and I really loved that drama and all the actors on it. While I do like romantic stuff I lean more on action, crime, mystery and historical settings. Anyways can\\'t wait for the drama. Oh hani all the very best to u and ur team #jungsomin I look forward to this. Somin is my fav actress. Her acting is really perfect and she is so beautiful. The name of drama is beautiful too, The Smile Has Left Your Eyes. Everything is good. Jung so min is from jellyfish and seo in guk is ex- jellyfish❤️? I\\'m soo excited for this drama kyaaa!! Finally!!! In Guk oppa is back!!! The cast is daebak! And finally ingukki is back?? Gukkie oppa <3 <3 <3 so excited for this drama. Ommo..! Finally SIG is back. Yippi.. Miss him much and can\\'t wait to see SIG\\'s brilliant acting as a suspected man of murder. Waiting for bae, seo in guk oppa hehehe i hope the ratings will get high as the stars from the sky! ive seen the japanese one which is i guess the original one and i must say that seo in guk really fits the bad ass protagonist here!!! the casting team is genius. seo in guk is perfect for that bad ass character and so does jung so min as the younger sister. ive watched the original one and i must say that both actors fit the character so so so much. so excited. cant wait. i hope everyone will love it and i pray that the ratings will get high as the million stars from the sky! Yes!!!!!!! Finally!!!!! Seo In Guk is back!!!!!! Lee Hongbin has been confirmed to be in this drama! I\\'m so excited to see him ♡♡♡ Lee Hongbin has been confirmed to be in this drama! I\\'m so excited to see him??? Waiting for seo in guk Waiting for this drama, Thank you In Guk for accepting this role. My Precious Forever? Great cast. Please pleaseee, cant wait anymore.... choosing seo in guk for vague badass antihero is really really genius move...he is fit for bad hero type character. I\\'m watching the japanese the story is very interesting The synopsis has me intrigued despite it being confusing...Will definitely watch because I\\'ve been a fan of Seo In-Guk since 38 Task Force and Jung So-Min is literally my favourite actress ever since BTIMFL <3 Opppaaaaaaa bogoshipdaaa <3 arrrrgh! OMG Lovvve Seo In Guk and Jung So Min! Its definetely The man and the detective\\'s sister, right? Bcause Somin-ssi\\'s character name is different with Seo in guk\\'s character name. I meant the family name.;) If the actor accepts, Park Sung-woong will play the detective/older brother. please let seo in guk & jung so min be the \"man and the detective\\'s younger sister\" yes..so min accept.. I love the leads tbh, but their faces and vibe is way totally different , considering this is a tragedy melo drama... we need a good actor for the detective\\'s role. Lee Sung Min is suitable for that! SIG will probably play the man based on the synopsis as that character is more likely the lead and the female lead is the detectives sister, forbidden love and tragedy for this one... All things tvN get my attention, and all things SIG get my attention, so I will absolutely be glued to the screen, at least metaphorically, for this show! I love how SIG transforms every single role, so much that his face looks like he is 10 years older or younger from expressions he makes (younger in the case of Shopping King) and like a different person entirely...his eyes are so expressive and he has SUCH great control of his facial muscles, maybe from singing so much, and indeed he is another underrated super talent! Jeong So Min would be a super match-she also is skilled and distinct looking (though not exactly unique since she looks so much like Yoon Eun Hye to me, so much as she settles into her adult face that in Because This is My First Life I thought it was the Coffee Prince in the role!! Sounds good but will the detective be SIG or will he be the suspected man? Please accept so min... Loooove seo in guk I\\'m glad he\\'s back! But why the plot synopsis almost feels like a summary though haha like there\\'s nothing left to assume you already know what\\'s going to happen on most parts? how is it a huge departure from SIG\\'s normal roles? detective or suspicious person with psychopath tendencies, he has played that before. He can play anyone. But the director is superb and have loved all his shows.Fingers crossed for this one. Jung so Min will be superb for this show but am not that psyched about Seo in Guk in this show as this will be a HUGE departure from his image.Still ,a big risk r Seo In Guk??? the best choice for the drama. can’t wait??❤️ Ahhh!! I\\'m so happy that jung so min and seo in guk are confirmed for this drama!! I LOVE somin! She\\'s been doing so many amazing projects! I\\'m so happy that her acting career is really taking off! Now, if this drama will have a great director and SCRIPT, this will be another hit! TvN is doing it so I\\'m hoping they won\\'t disappoint! Do you guys notice most of the dramas of 2018 are related to crimes?.....You know like judge, prosecutor, police,lawyer, serial killers.... like there is a given theme for dramas of 2018 ooooohhh nice cast oppa out of military past Accept it jung so min!! YAS!! YAS!! YAS!! Please Seo in Guk Please not seo. in gukk plz..!! please cast lee je hoon & jung so min.. Please please, seo in guk and jung so min....

I guess that woman prosecutor is the one who abducted her child. That\\'s why she really objected when Han Tae Gyu want to re-investigate the case. This is only my own guessing. I am happy to see Jung Woong-In cast as a lead drama character. I have seen him in supporting roles, in many dramas, over the last decade. This drama is brilliant. Keeps you hooked right from the first episode and the lead actress is not your usual damsel in distress. No one can mess with her. Fighting team Ms Ma nemesis! Does anybody know the movie that\\'s shown in episode two? It\\'s the one that\\'s shown to Ms Ma that makes her want to escape. The subtitles say it\\'s called \\'Shaman\\' but I can\\'t find any information on that. Has a lot of Agatha Christie\\'s 10 Little Indians, Korea\\'s The Village: Achiara\\'s Secret and Queen of Mystery. A lot going on in this show. My gut is telling me that the young policeman was the accomplice of the murder. Does anyone know which Miss Marple novel this is based on? is this defendant part2? during ep 19-20 of your honor they showed clips of defendant . was it for this show? I brought all the \"Miss Marple\" books by Agatha Christie for this drama. So excited. @kiki He did play a good guy in Ojakgyo Brothers and a bad/good guy in Yong Pal.. You can check out those shows Jung woong in will play as an antagonist again eh in this drama Kim Yunji??? LOL FOR REAL??? It\\'ll be splendid if she were to accept the role!!! Luv her movies and her acting in Lost and Mistresses. Cannot wait:-))) lol betting jung woong in might be the villian...hahaha or the husband. or in corrupt organization. hahha... i wish he got a good guy character. Ooh I love Agatha Christie novels I am going to enjoy this one',\n",

       "  'comments': 'This drama is so so good! The lead actresses are incredibly good! I cried a river... That’s so touching, Hwa Sa I such a strong woman Till the end of this drama, I didn\\'t get where ki yoo jin cruelty is, as said on the synopsis.. OMG!! I Cryyy A Riverrr on the last episode... it\\'s break my heart.. it\\'s hurt sooooo much seeing jang hwa sa and how the world is unfair to her. the love we strive for, can kill us. I realy like jang hwa sa and cho young bae love story. it\\'s so tragic but actually they care about each other.. and it\\'s soo hurt. I cried so much in the last episode. TT_TT Good!!♥~Oppa oneeee\"! A revenge drama involving three women and a doctor. that I might say. The miracle is happened coincidence. So far, I enjoyed this drama very much because the plot is very simple understanding. I really like this drama although many criticisms. Compare many dramas airing this month, this drama plot is still decent with own excitements. I love Kim Hee Sun as a greedy lawyer, Kim Young Kwang as a kind-hearted doctor and Kim Hae Sook as a woman who struggle to revenge her ex-bf I don\\'t know why I still watching this drama although the plot is so messed-up? Three leads are amazing, I guess. Anyone know who acted Jang Hwa Sa (younger)? If I\\'m not wrong in my assume, Ki-san \\'s father is the main caused for all this tragedy happened. He wants CYB to blame JHS as a killer and also killed Esther to hide KS identity. I like this kind of drama. Where the lead is pretty smart, strong and absolutely not that innocent haha. I like the plot, a bit slow but definitely a must to watch!! @Nihilism I guess KYJ\\'s mother (Esther) was real-Ki San\\'s girlfriend/secret wife back in america. So KYJ is actually real-Ki San\\'s son (that\\'s why he looks like him). Ki San\\'s father knew about it and took baby KYJ as his son after Esther\\'s death. Ki San\\'s father didn\\'t want to acknowledge him as grandson because he\\'s afraid that fake Ki San (Chu Young Bae) would get rid of KYJ (because he\\'s the real heir). Yes, I bet Ki San\\'s father has knew about fake Ki San all the begining because parents must recognize his own child. But why he didn\\'t reveal it? I still dont get the plot like who is the mother of KYJ, was she related to JHS? And how nobody talk about the real Ki San. I mean when you died and someone steal your identity. There must be someone who know about it even when you live abroad for a long time, like relative or friends or neighbour. And why the real Ki San look the same as KYJ. I know they have the same father, but different mother right? There must be mistakes on the writer and director, the show is getting off-track. A bit of disappointing about this whole plot. They don\\'t constant focus on her revenges and put out so many unrelated stories to it. Definitely, sure KYJ\\'s parents death is coincidentally with CYB greed and why he hatred JHS so much? Isn\\'t she willing to help him to steal his father money and commit suicide with him? 34 years of incarceration and on death row; she should be stronger, more determined and definitely more pissed off. Her character is way too weak. I was expecting Ice Adonis type of revenge but not this weakling. And that boy doctor who is completely blinded by his love for that gold digger noona is seriously starting to piss me off. The only character that I really appreciate is the evil illegitimate half brother. He is staying true to himself, bad trough the bones. Omg romance for the main lead so beautiful, how can they have deef fealings like that. So pitty for ki yoo jin that to tired but hae yi can’t comfort him I\\'m at episode 5 and I feel the drama is going too slow. The attorney was supposed to be the smart one, but she hasn\\'t tried to explain to Yoo Jin, but instead simply said a few words and thought that would be enough for him to believe her, but instead she sent a letter to her boss, when her boyfriend could have been her biggest ally. Also, the two female leads till now haven\\'t sit down to cooperate, to expain each other, I\\'m kinda frustrated with the way the story is going. Episode 5, I don\\'t understand why KYJ wanted to protect the killer without knowing who behind the curtain? He saw the bloody shoes but he didn\\'t call out the polices. Is he already assuming Eulji behind the curtain? I\\'m expecting they have a great romance but it doesn\\'t seem like that especially Kim Hee Sun casts. Love to watch these two veteran actress acting together and so far, the plot is really good. Keen to see what happening between them? Oh my god... i do like scene if ki yoo jin and eulji hae yi together , that\\'s very sweet and make me heart attack:* This does have a premise a lot like the Japanese drama SWITCHED and I thought that was scary, but this takes it up a notch higher. The only other twist that would make this even more devious if we find out the boyfriend is actually with his mother now..who is in his girlfriend\\'s body. Love the cast and such a great production. Can\\'t wait for more of this one! Finally, I found another great drama to fulfill my weekends. Superb like it. Haha........I feel Hae-yi get very adapted to her new surrondings while Hwa-sa need to learn a lot before she can revenge Ki-san and his gangs. Nice start, shouldn\\'t miss it. Revenge genre for sure. Love these two veteran actress and Ki Young Kwang. If jang hwa sa, yoo jin\\'s eomma for real, this is second time the actors in term of mother-son, after pinocchio Jang Hwa Sa has been prisoned for 34 years without knowing what happened in the past...she is innocent. Please Eulji lawyer...lend your body to reveal the truth... Already watched episode 1&2... Yes their body exchange..but i\\'m glad it happened...Jang Hwa Sa need to know the truth that happened 34 years ago...she is innocent...she went to jail for 34 years. Give her a chance Eulji lawyer....please be patient..she will return your body Haven\\'t started yet but watching the previews, seem interesting. These both women are great actress in K-dramas. @Bluez Thanks for the reminder, now I am curious about that also. Wow...can\\'t wait for this masterpiece....it contain of many great actor and actress like \"Kim Hee Sun\" and Kim Hae Sook\" OMG! Kim hee seon is my favorite actress and the plot seem to me very interesting... I can\\'t wait to watch it! Wow can\\'t wait. Kim Young Kwang and Kim Hae Sook previously worked together as mother and son in pinocchio. I am really curious how they will portray their role this time. Woa! The storyline is great! I\\'ll wait forward for this drama! OMG....Kim Hee Sook Eomoni... I love her so much..i wonder how she act as Kim Hee Sun body since most of her character she got is a warm hearted person. And what a rare surname Eulji is?? Love all the actors but quite frankly this plot sounds a bit offputting. Hope I\\'m wrong. Fantastic plot, can\\'t wait Sounds fascinating. Could be a pitch-black comedy about capital punishment and the haves and have-nots. Will look out for it. oh my! this sounds so interesting. can\\'\\'t wait interesting!!!! hmmmm like miracle we met',\n",

       "  'comments': 'Somehow, I found the 2nd lead\\'s storyline more interesting (Oh Dae Gi & Na Young Joo). As I continued watching, I found myself intently waiting for the next scene of this couple. Each scene between them kept me wanting more. Nice chemistry between them! Hope we get to see more of these two in another drama. ^^ Why they dont show lee je hoon face in last eps? Is that person not lee je hoon? I was lead to this story by Lee Je-Hoon. Having watched him in Fashion King and find him very dedicated to his role. And so he did not disappointed me. Awesome display of emotion and like someone earlier said, don\\'t think Hyun Bin or Park Bo-Gum can do it. So goes to Chae Soo-Bin. Very good skill as her character has a terribly messy life story. I am struggling to finish this drama. The first few episodes were good though tbh the storyline about an airport theme is really interesting and refreshing as i\\'ve never seen something like this before so far. but if i were to talk about the romance part, i wanna say i\\'m disappointed as i don see & feel any chemistry between lee soo yeon & han yeo reum. i actually think yeo reum and eun sub would be better together lol. tbh throughout the drama i\\'m actually more excited when i see oh dae gi & na young joo lolol they are so cute and i hope they could end up together. watched this drama because of chae soo bin ( han yeo reum ) cus she did great in I\\'m Not A Robot and here\\'s some of my opinion of this drama At the last episode there was an old man who worked as the manager of the Wifi lunchbox, I was wondering who he was because I think ive seen him before and I also wanted to know who was Dae Gi\\'s co-worker that handed him the car, im interested to know who this people actually are in not the serie, if you could tell me ill be really happy and also this was one of my favorite dramas;) I honestly like the drama but there a lot of things that are left out. But honestly I come here for that kpop group that was coming in... I wanna know who they were tbh...lol.... I’m just curious.... if anyone know pleaseu let me know... if you don’t just keep on scrolling Airport theme things & problems so interesting. Acting of each actors and actress so awesome too. Ha Reum\\'s character develops each episode. All character are strong although not all likeable. But the love story not interesting at all. Honestly it was an ok drama but the ending killed it for me. How could they not show his face at the end? They also left so many unanswered questions... I give 73% for this drama. I am just in episode 3. Omg.... so hate yeo reum Umm...felt like I was cheated or something, damn ending. Sorta made me had a minor meltdown like the drama Time-Shigan. Does anyone find it wired that Soo-Yeon\\'s face doesn\\'t show in the last secne? Lee Je Hoon\\'s performance in this drama is outstanding. Very convincing and he is good at crying, really makes me feel the sorrow and helplessness his character portrays. I doubt Hyun Bin or Park Bo Gum are able to deliver such impressive emotions. I can also feel his love for Yeo Reum. I only wished for more happy and sweet moments between Soo Yeon and Yeo Reum. Each time they plan to go dating or is about to share some romantic moments together, some unexpected events will occur. The drama really focused a lot on their love for each other. Yeah, it would have been great to see Soo Yeon\\'s face at the end, what a pity though. @Bob ikr? is SBS always like this? I found its not happened only for this drama. tbh if WSL had 40 eps it\\'ll much better. Seemed a rushed ending ... Many details and characters unaccounted for. Did station force the series to end without giving writer a chance to tie up all the loose ends? Cuteee security couple??? Omgg this dramaaaa is amazinggg. Recommended to watchhh and petition for the security couple to future as main roles in a rom com drama??? Is there a part 2?.... its originally 40 episodes in the beginning i dont know why they just make it into 32 im so upset.. This drama finally ended. I don\\'t know if I have yo be upset about all of the unanswered mysteries or kiss the scriptwriter because I know she did it in purpose (and to be honest, it left you think, to conclude what actually happens with your own imagination), so this is what I think about some mysteries SPOILERS! The plot of the story was quite good from the beginning to the middle of the episodes. But went on a down crash with han yeo trim over acceptance to everything Lee soo Yeon conditions.And Lee soo Yeon looking so obsessed with han yeo reum. I started out liking the drama and finding it very sweet. There is chemistry between main leads and second leads. Really rolled my eyes at absurd situations at the airport. Because if you slap a TSA agent you for sure will be taken to a small room and be searching thoroughly plus will be charged for aggression. The gangster plot in the last episodes is getting on my nerves. With the last two episodes lef I just hope they can clarify the plot holes and give this poor guy a happy ending. Initially I was gonna give up on this drama. I honestly wasn\\'t feeling it. It literally went from a 0 to 10. I don\\'t understand the hate, it\\'s so good . Wow, was so happy when I heard that name, Nigeria. Thanks for remembering us, even though it was brief, so enjoying the drama. All the best to the crew, looking forward to your visiting, I mean you guys visiting us here in Nigeria. Thanks. bored af with the story, i wish they would flesh out the nuances of Soo Yeon\\'s disability. So many plotholes and i find myself reading recaps and watching clips online instead of watching the whole episode Absolutely one of the best dramas I’ve watched. It really pulls you in the story and both, the main and second, relationships are so cute. The storyline is unique whereas it occurs in an AIRPORT! But I fell for Lee Je-Hoon and really, I praise all the actors & people who helped make this drama??❤️ But I’m SO curious how everything will end in ONE episode One more episode but, still don\\'t know where is yeo reum\\'s father now?is he still alive or did he died on accident or something?and then why seo timjang and choi timjang had an intense relationship?did they had an intense relationship because each other had feelings for yang timjang or something? This drama still have more question to answered for me Now I know why Hyun Bin/Park Bo Gum and Park Shin Hye/Suzy cause the drama started out good but it became insanely unrealistic in the middle of the plot. Lee Soo Yeon (Lee Je Hoon)\\'s character kinda became creepy which makes him looks obsess to the female lead. I felt disappointed watching this drama but i have to finish for the sake of finishing it. Just watch other dramas like #TheBeautyInside, #Still17 and #TheLastEmpress which currently airs now. i\\'m getting bored with the gangster plotline and SY is so stubborn to the point of being annoying now. Only one more episode left but nothing much has been resolved, hopefully they can wrap everything up without rushing the plotline. Ep 15: A bit unrealistic.! Started out nice but as usual somewhere the directors, scriptwriters went retarded. I recommend ppl to stop watching the moment Soo-Yeon and Yeo-Reum kissed and treat that as ending. Why is there an O K corral around the main lead character? I literally watched this drama because It\\'s a rare drama. Incheon airport? I never heard any drama based on airport before. Well correct me. But I fell in love with Lee Je hoon acting! He portrayed the character so well. For Chae Soo bin , I watched her drama before. She did better. A clumsy girl is nothing new but how she developed made me amazed. Respect to all the crew! Really recommend weirdly noticed, He Joon was also carrying a walkie talkie on his drama Signal.? Is this a coincidence? Chae Soo Bin! Bravo! I like how you portrait this simple girl, not smart, sometimes makes mistakes, but very warme heart. Every girl can identify herself in your character because it is not artificial, it is very natural and honest. And LSY who wants a normal life fell in love in 3 seconds for you. I hope that lee je-hoon\\'s character wil not die in this Korean Drama..i love his character so much. Really loooooveeeeeeee this kdrama especially with Lee Je Hoon. Become his fans after watching this drama. His acting skills is no kidding riteee???? His facial expression really moves my heart. You can really feel his emotion. His face says it all. Lee Je Hoon is soooo charming in this drama. Can\\'t imagine LSY role played by another actor. Love uuuuuu Lee Je Hoon ^_^ Totally fall in love with this drama.. I love the way LSY treat n talk with HYR. His sweet voice..??? Totally fall in love with this drama.. I love the way LSY treat n talk with HYR. His sweet voice..??? Omg. I like the second couple too. Hahaha dae gi and na young joo ♡♡hoping for more scenes that are sweet This drama is extremely good. It\\'s happy and sad, interesting and beautiful. Lee Je-Hoon, Chae Soo-Bin and Kim Kyung-Nam are so talented, I watch episodes at first in Rakuten Viki without subtitles (I can\\'t wait them) and later second time with subtitles:) i ship oh dae gi & na young joo. Pls more scene about oh dae gi & na young joo, they are so cute. Highly recommended this drama. It\\'s a dream team: Lee Je Hoon, Chao So Bin and Lee Dong Gun and the english ost is so beautiful. This drama was excited and made my heart race, and couldn\\'t wait longer to see the next episode. Hope the lead actor, Lee So Yeon and actress, Han Yeum Reun will have a happy ending. really like this show! the airport shenanigans may not make sense sometimes but the main and secondary couples are so cute together. i have a major crush on lee je hoon now ☺️ I love love,!!!! This show!!... it’s getting better and better... but the cliffhanger in today’s episode was so sad?!!!!....I hope nothing terrible happened to Han Yeo Reum!! Omg. Some part doesn\\'t make sense. Can\\'t they just make it more realistic? I think the plot about daily problem working in airport its self is great but some part is a bit exaggerating. Can\\'t stand to keep watching it altho there is Je Hoon in it. T.T this drama is so good!! highly recommended... at first, han yeo reum was so annoying but if you’re going to watch the next episode, you can see that han yeo reum’s character is developing. That is why i love this drama because the story, plot and actors who were really good!!! I really love the chemistry between lee soo yeon with han yeo reum and oh dae ki with na young joo!! I wish the ratings are getting higher because it deserves the award! Love to see how awkward Oh Dae Gi and Na Young Joo together. Will they end up loving each other? I ship them together ❤️ In love with this kdrama??? Ive got to say this is my favorite series so far. This makes my heart Flutter Who\\'s the Cute guy who got hitted with a bottle on episode 16??? I really love this series! It’s sweet yet not all about love story. I wish the ratings were Higher. This drama is so good. People give this drama a chance. You will love it once you start watching each and every episode. Each week gets better and better. Great drama, the best in the autumn 2018. Talented actors. I love this drama but i chae so bin’s makeup is too white for her. Its keep me distracting when i look at her. Can her mua choose the perfect shade for her??? ISTG I Hate Seo In Woo! -______- Ep 8 (29 Oct 2018); The drama is unrealistically depicting SKorea as a lawless place where passengers can mistreat/abuse airport staff and then get an apology and compensation, as if paying pax are drama queens/kings. Is there no airport police to handle unruly and abusive pax, eg arrest and jail them.? I Im confused about Choi Moo-ja. Is he trustworthy or an enemy? Rowoon i love u??? Love the fact that they keep Soo-yoon’s identity a mystery till a certain episode. Lee soo yoon, totally swoon by his character! I like the combination of Lee soo yoon and han yeo reum! hmm during 14 first episoded, I like Ko Eun Sub character better than Soo Yeon, if only he can express his feelings to Yeo Rum, I bet they will be more than best friend..:) anyone has the same idea? in natural, Eun Sub is more manly than Soo Yeon.. Soo Yeon had more power because of his helper device.. I really like this drama. It\\'s my favourite from the ones i\\'m watching right now, and i think that it is mostly because of Lee Je Hoon portray of the character. I really like the main couple as well, they balance each other pretty well. Nice?? This drama is annoying. It often goes overboard to impress and most of the time doesn\\'t make any sense. The only good actors here are Lee Je hoon and Lee Dong gun, the reason why I watch but this time, I\\'m sure I\\'ll drop this sorry...... cant wait to see all episode...really good drama plot, story and actors are really good..i love it. excited to see all episode. Drama plot is so new and is interesting too! Can\\'t stop thinking of the possible scenes on the next episodes; love it!!!! I really love Je hoon\\'s character and also chae soo bin they are really good to see together and I am very impressed to the story!? Loved Lee Je Hoon\\'s acting since the series \\'Signal\\'. A wonderful series that made you wished that love really happens \\'Where Stars Land\\'. oh gosh im glad that the main roles belong to Lee Je Hoon and Chae Soo Bin I\\'ve liked her since Cheer Up lol I love the show so far!1 And people wondering about the OST it will be released soon..cant wait until its out!!! I am so glad that the other actors and actress\\'s declined this drama. Lee Je-Hoon is perfect. Chae Soo-Bin is doable since I liked her in I Am Not A Robot. I am liking this drama very much and Lee Je-Hoon is at the top of my list for actors. Super good movie . I have a question please someone tell me who knows the song with the lyrics “ someday in your life burning a different way” the always play in this kdrama I really like that song but I can’t find it what is the title. Thanks in advance Wow,didn\\'t know the show was from the writer /director of Romantic Doctor,Gu Family Book,Gentleman Dignity,Secret Garden etc..as the show has been flying under the radar.. Whenever I hear the English ost it hits me harder. got hooked up with this drama. Am I the only one who likes eun sub with yeo reum? ㅠ_ㅠ but good drama and the main characters so good. Quite interesting story.:) Just finish watched episode 10. Become a fan of Lee Je Hoon . He\\'s so charming in this drama. Super loveeeeeeeeeee his chemistry with Chae So Bin . They look so cute together ^_^ Become a fan of Lee Je Hoon in this kdrama. Love his chemistry with Chae Soo Bin. They\\'re sooooooooooooo cute together. Lee Je Hoon sooooooo charming in this drama ^_^ plot got a little exaggerated, it\\'s not really making sense, can airport service staff board an aircraft which made an emergency landing,how can crew leave a lone pax unattended and deplane themselves, where\\'s the captain, no airport security guards at door? How did he manage to get to the aircraft which is parked outer bay? How did he manage to get back inside terminal alone? The unreleased OST heard in recent eps is by male soloist Sewoon!! So looking forward to the full song:D I really like this drama so far! Chae Soo Bin\\'s character can be a little annoying at times but I\\'m also liking her so far! (Spoiler alert) The chemistry is good but I wasn\\'t expecting her guy friend to like her. That\\'s gonna be interesting to see how he realizes that he likes her but she can\\'t reciprocate her feelings. When le je hoon looks so young i didnt realize that he\\'s 10 years older than chae soo bin, his skin is so flawless omg mine is like potato??? but their chemistry is soooo lovely i love them?? this drama is super cute!! Who knows the song on episode 5-6? The one with the \"bye bye bye neol saenggakhae yojana\" lyrics? Whos know ost on eps 5-6?? Chae soo bin is a talented young actress..She never disspointed me in potraying her characters..same as han yeo reum..if you said her character is annoying then yes,she succeed her character .. i really love her character in thief who stole the people.. so pls guys , support fox bride star , this drama is really interesting , great plot , talented cast , beautiful scenery & different vibes from other dramas❤️ This drama really hooked me!!! I think Yeo-Reum is a lovely character. Yeah, she is indeed too clumsy, has so many bad lucks and not really confident. But what important is how she tries to understand Lee Soo Yeon, how she is not noisy about his secret, how she cares for him more than he do to himself. That is so damn sweet. I can see how other characters (and audiences) dislike her, but I can understand why Soo Yeon simply mushy toward her. Soo Yeon doesn\\'t smile (or, smile sincerely) for almost 4 episodes straight, but then he slowly falls for her and then he smiles alot, most of time, secretly, while watching her. I just love how they heal each other Many people complaining about han yeo reum characters. For me, i am absolutely okay with it. She has flaw and slowly, will change for good. Well, this is the writer\\'s styles. Previously, in romantic dr teacher kim, they wrote yoo yeon seok character as egotistic, full of pride, rude and selfish dr. But, he slowly changes throughout the episodes though it takes more than half of the drama. I agree with Alexa. Yeo reum is really frustrating sometimes.But sometimes I feel that I would have done the same things....teehee. If i look lee soo yeon\\'s characters. I remember do min joon character from man from the stars. Kiyowo I enjoy a lot of kdramas, and this drama\\'s premise is really interesting, but I have to say, that Han Yeo-Reum is one frustrating character. It\\'s like the writer went out of their way to make her unlikeable. It is alright to portray what are in the end realistic, human traits, but her flaws outnumber her qualities. Might be my unpopular opinion, but she really needs some redeeming qualities. I apologize in advance if I annoyed anyone by venting my frustration with the character. What is the english ost of where the stars land / fox bride? Thank you Pls. let me know the English ost?on episode 8? Thanks in advance... Really nice drama.... I love the plot Very nice drama.i really love it?? Surprisingly the drama is becoming better and worth to watch. Some casts are quite not in place but overall everyone of them are doing great. Chae Soo Bin <3 @raylene...same to me...I admire his acting skill and his expression...so lovely? Lee Je Hoon fighting! Such a promising drama. The ratings also show. Looking forward to the following episodes. Ejay & Lauren brought me here #pinoypride and I also love CSB coz of her acting skill in I Am Not A Robot. Too many cliche scenes and slo-mo it\\'s just... lee je hoon. i really miss his facial expression while he\\'s acting. he\\'s such a good actor for me So many stars passed on this drama, it would be funny if this drama becomes a big hit lol Fighting! ??Please let me know the title of the English song on episode 2 on the last part. Thank you. This is a hoot! If you’re looking for a easy going, fun and frivolous drama this is it. If you’re watching ‘The Guest’ this Mon/Tues drama will calm your nerves and prep you for Wed/Thurs night. I haven’t seen any of Chae Soo Bin’s drama so this a first and 15 minutes in to the first episode- I’m staying. It’s worth the time spent just watching her character development and storyline so yep feeling good vibes from this. I’m glad all the actors declined the roles as the cast chosen suit their roles more. Hahahah I’m glade that they declined, I don’t want to Hyun-Bin and Park Shin-hye, I just don’t think they will have that great chemistry? well maybe they could surprise me tough? Park shin hye, park bo gum and suzy was all offered the main lead role for this drama... im glad we get to see soo bin as a main lead for once. Im a huge fan of park shin hye but i appreciate the writers have given the opportunity to soo bin unnie!!! ❤❤❤ Lee Je Hoon oppa fighting! oh how i miss chae soo bin, yeah she is the reason why i watch this drama I’m already hooked. After watching ep 1, awesome story...the actions-scenes were amazing, the save-me schizo scene was great..had tears when watching that. A blend of many emotions...will surely be waiting for more great scenes, interesting plots & beautiful acting with this story. Ljh is amazing- with his sultry look & csb is doing well too. What I\\'ve seen in the first 4 episodes of \"Where Stars Land\" is absolutely stunning, starting with the visuals of the Incheon International Airport, where this entire drama is set. Every scene is shot from numerous moving angles, so that we get to see not only the characters, but also the passengers rushing into the aisles of the airport, or the sun rising and setting through the huge glass windows, as the airplanes waltz around the landing field. This is poetry in motion! I\\'ve never seen this beautiful an airport on film (let alone in real life). And I mentionned only the visuals. I won\\'t have the time to comment on the script and on the actors, which are amazing as well. Anyway, don\\'t miss \"Where Stars Land\"! Wow the male lead is the one who play with suzy in arch101 Am chae soo bin fan ( India) . And so far I like this drama . I thot it\\'s not going to be good but to my surprise it\\'s really good . I just watch becoz of her . Thank you director and writer. This is interesting story..the cast is so good too..but i cant stand the han yeo reum character! So annoying..but she delivers her character so well..i hope the story develope in more beautiful way I think his right arm is artificial only.. they didn\\'t mention on this drama if there\\'s fantasy genry. Wow, the actor Kim Woon Hae is all over the place. He just finished the medical drama “Life” then he’s in “Ghost Detective“ and now here in “Where Stars Land” Wow, so busy, he’s a good character actor. Finished watching first 4 episodes. I got excited when I saw the cast. All three are my favorite actors so obviously, my expectations were high. The plot is interesting so far, very gripping.? So many mysteries yet to uncover. A bit slower in the beginning but I am sure the story will develop in the next few episodes. But still not able to figure if it\\'s a fantasy genre because only melodrama and romance was mentioned. I hope it\\'s fantasy cuz it looks like LJH has some sort of superpower.??As usual like other K-dramas, the cinematography is beautiful. Cool visuals. Music good so far. Already in love with the english track in the 1st ep. Go watch it! I recommend it to everyone who is in for a light-hearted drama. don\\'t know why they rejected this beautiful drama, but its a blessing that Soo bin and Je hoon accepted this. This would be my new favorite drama.. Fighting!!!! Wuuuuu i love this 2 episode, i think their chemistry is good tought, and every episode have different problem and story so we can\\'t predict the plot. really love the cinematography,remind me of temperature of love 2 episode so good. Glad lee je hoon & chae soo bin accept it. They fit the role really well Dear kdrama-addict: i think it’s your own perspective, maybe for you it’s boring but for others it’s not. Woahh!!! A very fantastic drama, the writer is indeed infinite when it comes to imagination and also, the details about the airport and it\\'s situation is so professional, like this is the first time I saw a drama taking place in a crowded venue. Indeed, the writer is very detailed when it comes to professionalism. @ anna funny that its really a supernatural drama. lmao this is what happens if youre commenting in something that you still dont know Please look forward to SF9’s Rowoon ^^ this drama surprisingly good, didnt have high expectation toward this drama before First episode was good. Chae soo Bin just more beautiful in this drama btw. chae soo bin <3 The poster is so good. wowwwwwww boring af, not recommended, not worth the time.. The teasers look like a commercial ad... it\\'s a shame that Hyun Bin and Park Shin Hye declined the roles. It looks good! 3 superbe actors together: Lee Je Hoon, Chae Soo Bin and Lee Dong Gun. Definitely a good drama to watch. 3 superbe actors together: Lee Je Hoon, Chae Soo Bin and Lee Dong Gun. Definitely a good drama to watch. I think the lead actor has supernatural ability..... Omg can\\'t wait for this drama...? From the previous title, I thought it was going to be something supernatural, but it\\'s just a regular workplace drama then? This is one of drama which i anticipated for this second-half year. I hope this drama will be loved and successful since the PD, writer, and actors are one of the best in K-Drama industry. I\\'m pretty sure this one will be suffers on K-Drama\\'s second-half year competition! YOUTH!!! See you soon, 여우각시별! So this is the korean drama where Filipino celebrities Ejay Falcon and Lauren Young will be in. Looking forward to watch this!! Oh please... Heres another one. I want to sleep too, but how? i dont even have enough time to watch them all:?? I can feel that this drama will be successful... I look into the writer biodata, she wrote a lot of high rated and popular drama such as Romantic Doctor Master Kim, Gu Family Book, What\\'s Happen to My Family and Kim Tak Goo... I think my post drama syndrome will be cured with this drama after 30 But 17 end tonight... Seokwoo-ya, fighting! ^_^ I am SO looking forward to this drama! I like THREE main casts.:D Can\\'t wait! I love everyone in this cast. And yes I\\'m doing a happy dance too! Not sure what the story line is, or genre, but just the cast alone has me excited. Can\\'t wait.. 2 my fav actors are the leader. Damnnn ao happy Yessssssss Lee Je hoon is backkkkkkkk!! Cherry on top is Le Je Hoon and Chae Soo Bin are coming together ... Is it me or anyone else doing happy dancing?????????? Wow lee je hoon oppa aand rowoon, cant wait Lee Je Hoon oppa finally!!!!!!! Good luck and sucess, i love you so much <3 <3 <3 lee dong gun again!!!!! finally another mini drama ❤❤❤❤ I hope there\\'s a love line with soo bin hmmm i hope a good drama but with airport theme life story in it ,just like good luck jdorama or up in the air Me me me. Give me the main role. Jehoon and soobin pls accept the offers! @UriNamoo I don\\'t think it\\'s a fantasy-oriented drama. The title could probably translate to something else Want jeon so min or kim tae hee take the role.Pls Oh please lee je hoon.... Kim so hyun..kim so hyun.. Oh? It sounds like Chinese Drama “moonshine and valentine”? I don’t know, Victoria is the female lead. The male lead is a fox that came from another planet, he also have a problem with his eyes (which is completely blind) bcs he’s a half human. The only cure for his eyes is the liver of the girl he loves (yea, so ironic). kim sae ron or kim ji won please dor lead female!!! they declined ji soooo please and Kim sae Ron please Han hyo joo too old for park bogum. actress like suzy/chae so bin/kim you jung/ nam ji hyun/park hye soo/kong seung yeon/kim so hyun/etc. They will be matches.. Cant wait bogum and suzy?? I believe that Han Hyo Joo & Park Bo Gum will be the great couple & visual couple & perfec couple if they couple in this role..PDnim Han hyo joo please please please please Han hyo joo pleaee han hyo joo please please You\\'re kidding right? If you look at the drama ratings before and after her dramas, you can see that her dramas have done significantly better than those before and after it. Of course, it is because of both the Suzy hype and her costars\\' hype. She gets a lot of drama offers—why? Because the directors want her. It\\'s not her fault that they do. She chooses her roles very carefully and if she decides to accept and if Park Bogum decides to accept, then I\\'ll happily support and watch this drama. LOL I don\\'t think you quite understand how popular she is among netizens (the general public) in Korea. There\\'s a reason everyone screams Suzy and she has remained very relevant for many years. cant wait to watch this drama...... can\\'t waitt pleaseee acept the roleee. Not to sound rude, but suzy\\'s dramas always flopped in Korea eg uncontrollably fond and wyas. Park bom gum too even though they are quite famous there, but when it comes to drama k-netizen always judge it from the plot and acting compared to inteenational fans who supporr just for the sake of supporting. Seems her supports come more from international fans rather than K-netizens. This drama seems boring, with suzy mediocre acting skills, I hope she will reject it. Boring plot and mediocre acting skills will only gain more criticisms for her. cant wait for baeksang award!! MC park bogum and Bae Suzy! i\\'m in if both accept the role!! i hope bogum will accept this role, we don\\'t see him acting since 2016 and i miss him so much:( him and suzy would be a really great couple accept it please suzyaaa we\\'re waiting for ur comeback, love u from a fan:) I\\'m happy omg both are my fav actor actress:( accept it please. can\\'t waitt pleaseee acept the roleee. park bo gum please accept the role!! big fan of suzy hope she\\'ll accept it!! come on suzy you need to play with most popular actor in korea right now!! this is will hit daebak;D look forward for this drama!! suzy yaaaa lets go accept this with park bo gum too suzyyyaaaa accept the role... this is the time to shine in ratings queen. please accept the role....... visual couple i like it. please accept the role bae suzy and park bo gum Omooo my favourite actor park bo gum will come back!! i hope you accept this one bogumahhh we miss you so much comeback to smallscreen again!! park bo gum accept please,Looking forward to see you again in a new drama soon ... i smell Drama Of The Year YALL. can\\'t wait!! please suzy and park bo gum you must accept this one! pleasee accept both of youuu.. this is will shocking the entire South koreans!! the ratings will high for sure:) Omg i can\\'t fcking wait for this drama.... you guys need to accept this drama!:))) suzy pleaseee accept it:) we miss you!

Woah ._. Park Bo-Gum please you must accept this, because u play with goddess from korea. Nations First Love:)) so writer changed the plot? and park shin hye didn\\'t accept the offer right?:( tbh it looks boring than the previous one @Qryi suzy i really wanted to see you again! we miss you! please comeback to kdramaland as soon as possible. waiting for u baby gurl:) Park Bogum and Hyeri.

       "  'comments': \"I dunno about this one. I liked the premise. I liked the cast, but this story is so slow as it plods along. I'm not sure I'm romantic enough for this one. This is one of the best detailed infos on a drama. Good job??. We have almost all the photos of the actors, which is fantastic? ❤️. So, thanks you guys?? Looking forward to seeing Shin hyun soo in a leading role.... More drama for him.. What about the first scene of episode 1? Is it connected with the ending or what? Lowkey also fell in love with Cha Hyunoh? Kinda disappointed about the last episode though...why did they end it like that???!??? Wow. Episode 12 is short. First time see the main character,cha hyun o i think he is jung il woo.. but i was wrong. I am enjoyed watching this drama. I think that i can feel the charachters pain. People have their own strugle. And so do i. Watching this can be healing thing for me, sometimes it's really hurt to handle our problem, but we have to face it. this is one of those dramas you cant take lightly..if you're into something fast this wont do..you need time to accomplish and appreciate where the cast and writer are leading you too. slow pace but somehow deep...i like it... dumb. it progressively gets worse towards the end. too many flashbacks, too slow, too full of sentimental fluff. The producer has managed to make me dislike hyun-o towards the end, he is so indecisive, full of self-pity and perpetually sad. If you want to watch a good one, MY MISTER is the real deal. Like this drama...the best story... Love this drama so much.. Can't wait for the last episode:(( This drama is special as it depicts a journey of lives that cross with one another time and again. It makes me wonder how our lives would have changed if we made a different choice or taken a different path... I used to do some solo traveling too... wondering and hoping maybe too, that life will be kind enough that I could find a soulmate on one of these trips... Can anyone tell me what is the real name of hae ran? Can anyone tell me what is the real name of hae ran?? Can anyone tell me what is the real name of hae ran?? 2018 and the two leads are far apart than ever in this drama. So far this drama has been engaging, I wait patiently with high expectations for the last few episodes. So far this is the best drama of 2018 for me. I cried a river. Can't wait for the next so. I love the balance of this drama. Waiting! I'm not ready to watch it. Episode 7 so far. I really hate the main girl, so inconsistent. Hope they ended up together. Love this drama so much.. Can't wait for the new episode every week.. Wish this could be longer like 16 episodes.. I love this drama, makes me want to travel to find my soul mate. There is something mellow and comforting about it but even then it is just too slow. I feel like I'm actually watching paint dry. I love this drama. Heartwarming This series is so warm and lovely The story is very unique and I like it..... No infact I love it..... This drama is going to be in my favourite list.......A very realistic plot ..... Talks about common problem that most teenagers are facing nowadays..... I just love love love this drama...... (Fingers crossed) Have very high expectations from this and I hope it meets all my expectations???????..... Btw... I like all the actors and actresses from here Japanese guy with a Korean blood in that personality.. I want to meet one. Healing for your heart and your mind I feel like watching dorama because of their look:3 i think i saw Cha Hyun O somewhere, and then i remember that the main leads both play roles in Age of Youth s1 & s2 I think I will watch since my hammie is the lead. They're in Age of Youth season 1&2. Woooo!!!\",\n",

       "  'comments': \"Its worth to watch and definitely not too cliche.the fight between brother is not dragging and ended cleanly for me. I kindda like it that the younger brother take the hint about the girl feeling and step down from the triangle relationship.he doesnt look pitiful rather he look awesome to me ❤ its my first time to watch SHIN DONG WOOK and he is really doing a great job for this role. Minhyuk is such an eye candy and Kiri is hilarious.Nice storyline writer-nim.....FIGHTING!!! I know that kdrama-land has a lot of clichés and I'm fine with that. But when a drama has an illogical story line just in order to repeat the same cliché, that's where the problem starts (I mean the relationship between main female and the two brothers, ugh). Dropped it after ep14 episode 15 dropped and i expected more from this drama, especially from the older brother!!...the guy is a total douche bag!!! being the oldest you would think he'll give his younger brother a chance a love and if it was meant to be then he should be happy and not try to be a dick and spoil their dates!! the younger brother has got bigger balls then the oldest, calling her up and admitting defeat and yet the oldest runs over with a sloppy pathetic feel-sorry-for-me lines to reel her in again!! im more interested in Han jin-Mi story line now!!..glad this is only 16 episodes!!! cant take this anymore!! lol At first I thought it was the let’s eat girl but it’s not. Just watched the first episode. I like the food angle and the closeness among the siblings. Logically trying to figure out how they always managed to eat together between college entrance exam mandatory study period and military service. I wish there was a new trend in South Korea to eat dinner together every single night. Or at least 6/7. The Hanok styled home is lovely. There's no explanation other than retardness for that cold guy to treat the girl that way after she confessed. She should just forget that cold bastard and go to his brother instead. Aww... Jin mi won me!! Even though other actors are pretty good but my eye catcher is Jin mi and minhyuk chemistry. Writer Nim plz give them more screen space ...chebaal so good This drama reminds me of how bad Let's Eat 3 was. And, it kinda makes me wish this was the third season of it. It takes me back to the greatness of the first season of Let's Eat. Eps 12 that you've watched is eps 6. Just divide it by 2 because the drama air 2 eps every Thursday. And some website count it 1 eps per day or 2 eps per day. As per today this drama has 8 or 16 eps I dont get it. I have watched all of episode from 1-12 somehow. The story seems unfinished and i feel like theres gonna be the next episode (they literally put trailer in the video). But i waited and no new episode uploaded?? Can some1 pls explain lol Ep 6 - OMG! Kim Jimin is with Kim Kiri. LOL! The reunited Gag concert comedians! =D I watch this drama because Yuri. it's kind of weird but it's really funny, I never watch any drama like this. You should try it out, from Ep5, the story get more interesting I heard Shownu from Monsta X will make a cameo so here I am checking the drama out?? Hardcore foodie drama. Shades of those recent japanese food dramas like Kantaro and Samurai Gourmet. Do not watch this while hungry I start watching this drama.. and i think it's worth to watch. There are romance, comedy, working, and also culinary story.. Look at the foods... while watching the scene, it makes me to taste it.. It looks yummy..... Minhyuk is so cute...I like his acting... I only come for Jin Mi's convenience store's recipes. and Min Hyuk;) Feeling my appetite rise, my saliva running out, and getting hungry.. Is this food show or a drama? Hahhahaha really really like this.. I wish this drama was 2 episodes a week. I really love the chemistry between Yuri and Shin Dong Wook! <3 I like this drama because i love food and always love drama about food. Like let's eat and honsul/drinking solo. But the way Han San Hae-ssi explain the food is too long, especially when he rapping about the food. So sorry for skipping that part. I personally love the part when Jung Sik and Ji Min making food much better than the too long food explain. Thanks for making this drama. Hope it will be much better next time. Fighting! It is like lets eat season 4. But the gourmet keep explaining the food inside his mind, really nice drama hahaha Kim Dong Wook and Lee Min Hyuk are sooo goodlooking???I love this drama I think I can learn how too cook Han Jung Sik?? I love this drama. Finally, a drama for Shin Dong Wook that I can watch because I love his character here. I just love to look at that handsome face all day *swooning with heart eyes* Always hungry when i watch this... I came here for food. I like the drama! I like the characters and the story, but the overly long food scenes are getting super boring. How can you talk about one single food for 6 minutes straight? I'm only watching for the drama, not the food prep and the 10 minute long eating scenes. Just tried to watch this drama.. Hoping to like it but I didn't expect to really like it..the chemistry of shin dong wook and yuri is superb.. can't stop smiling and squealing at them.. Shin Dong Wook is so handsome..?? Just finished watching the episode 3 and the flow is getting better and better.. Their acting is so good.. Their chemistry is undeniable.. Just tried to watch the drama but I can't stop feeling hungry and smiling.. I can't stop squealing with their chemistry.. Just finished watching ep. 3 and the flow is getting better and better..???? Hard for me to watch this. It's making me hungry!!! First episode shows a lot of promise! Yuri is delightful as always and it’s great to see Shin Dong-Wook in a lead role again. The low number ratings are undeserved and almost certainly the work of antis. first episode is so good but i dont understand who give score in this . this drama have 67 point avarage . this is so good . this should to 90+. i like how the show the foods, make me want to eat . . . . hope this drama more focus on the food than the love story . . . . . . I really love the 1st episode. It's quite funny and lighthearted. I like the cast. And oh my god the food they show... Really makes you crave for korean food. And there are really some interesting traditional korean food that i've never seen before. Truly recommend this drama. Makes you happy, and hungry. Wowowowowowo. Definitely going to watch it... because of yuri Unni... I love her acting skills.... my bias omg my ultimate bias yul eon... aawww i'll wait for this drama??? Shin Dong Wook as main lead? no matter how much episode this drama has, i will watch this!!! Yuri is really good played tole as cheerful and funny's heroine character. Actually i want Yuri playing cold women like Choi Anna ini fashion king (the first her role on drama as second female main cast ). sjdhdhs I hoped that Yuri was playing someone who was a descendant of Dae Jang Geum but oh well Omg, shin dong wook is back!!!\",\n",

I almost died while watching episode 7! this is so crazy XD You have to watch this bcs this dorama really hilarious yet serious fight scene! Oooooh, there are cameo such as Oguri shun and Yamazaki kento.... Hoping for the second season in Taidou XD So happy this gets more popular. Overall good adaptation even though the only episode that completely followed the Manga is the 7th (the best in my opinion). So many lovable characters in this drama, I love them all. Especially Mukunoki-sensei, the fake-ass Kinpachi-sensei, lol. What a great teacher he is. This is so fun to watch. I never knew this was a Live Action, great thing I havent read the manga or watch the anime since I dont wanna be spoiled. But you guys need to check this out,especially in ep 7.? The victim from genji's salon. Lol 1st episode is really good. One of the best shows this season. CAMEO scene: The barbershop's name is Genji (an easter egg because of a very famous role. Even his haircut is the same.) I heard this one will have a dozen more cameos from Japan's top stars. I've watch 1st episode raw, wondering if this LA dorama years setting in current year or the 90s coz' of the girls hairstyle. Didn't expect that barber owner, hahaha...not gonna spoil anything, but seriously 'he' took waaay different path in his life. This will be good. Fukuda rarely disappoints. Hope he surpasses Blue Blazes. KEEN!! I loved the anime OVAs so I'm looking forward to how the live version will turn out. kentaro x kanna??? Yessss! Can’t wait to see Kentaro! ❤️❤️❤️\",\n",

I really like it. the cast are also great actors and actresses and also kakoiii ^^ love from Indonesia <3 @Agustina Eka: where do you watch Legal V episode 8? Some streaming stuck at 6th episode. 8th episode is just released. Can't wait for the 9th!! I think the main story is just starting! So exciting! This drama lawyer version of Doctor X, Shoko lost liscense and opening small and strong firm just like Akira in Doctor X. Otaka has role same as Kaji sensei Whoaaa it looks like Daimon Sensei and Kaji Sensei,Shibasaki Chiaki and Kaede are having reunion.Ureshii na! Daimon sensei & Kaji sensei reuinion..!! Nanao and Ryoko, just wow? two strong woman in one drama. Love the show and the cast! I will never fail in my case! Yass! Ryoko-san is back to slay:) And she's back! I love Doctor X, but Yone-san is an actress! She has to move on in order to grow and I must say by her movements alone in the short teaser, the character seems quite interesting! Here's to a successful season! Be sure to watch everyone! v(^-^)victory!\",\n",

       "  'comments': 'The original Japanese version of this is much better. I am a fan of Cha Tae Hyun so I was really sad when reading the comment. He is a good actor, if you watch all his movies, you will see how he incarnates into a very cool character. He is an actor not only appearing on a variety of shows. Although the film has no passion, it has a profound meaning. The character in the movie has a very different personality from him in real life, so acting like that is very good. When I saw his movie I saw that it was not Cha Tae Hyun. Hope he will have more products. The drama deserved its low ratings. Worst adaptation I\\'ve ever watched. go watch the original and don\\'t waste your time with this. I love that most of KBS shows convey deep meaning. Well wrapped ending, learn a lot from this drama. This drama is a gem. well written,directed and acted. I don\\'t understand with the ratings:( I’m having a really hard time getting through episode one with the coffee scene. Look I know there have been similar cases. Maybe that is why it bugs me. Someone assaults you like that you call the police and go to the ER for treatment. Love her in someday and cloud atlas. Was he in the gods movie? Not getting chemistry but both are fine actors. Was this coffee incident a one time thing or do more violent yet never get justice incidents happen? Do security guards get flashing lights in their vehicles? Seen a few passing scenes on cable and want to know if it’s worth it to start and the beginning and get through it all? Love this drama... nice ending too, good job for all cast:) Guys why did seok-koo had an affair? He seems like a good guy tho I cried a lot at the 16th episode, i don\\'t know but it hurts a lot..... I really like this drama... so much love that keep coming out.. an eye opener for those who keep questions to themselves... lovelots..:) I cried so much watching ep23-24, i think i can feel hwiroo\\'s feeling.. omg...cha tae hyun is a comic genius!! Absolutely loving this drama. i also thought it was change of partners but upon watching ep23-24, it wasn\\'t AHHHHH i really luv this drama at first, i enjoyed the story about seokmu and whiruu, their conflict, whiruu with shihoo disgusting. change of partners. Wow, this drama only has multifaceted characters with a lot of depth and understanding of how complex real marriage/relationships can be. I can relate to Suk Moo a lot, as I can be quite oblivious and self-centered without knowing or meaning to be. I think there are a lot of men and women who can relate to the characters in this drama and it really has a modern take on marriage, religion, and feminism of Korea. I really enjoy it and think it just as good as the original. What a good drama! I enjoy it so much TT so much emotional. Also I\\'ve learned lots from this drama too. This is the most disappointing drama I\\'ve ever watched. The original is miles better because It\\'s real life, it isn\\'t infected by gender politics or feminism. The original drama has more in common with Wife\\'s Credentials than this sh*tty adaptation. If you want a good and intelligent look into marriage, divorce and the sufferings of women just go watch Wife\\'s Credentials or the original japanese drama. This one is just feminist crap posing as an adaptation. send my love to this drama, the casts and all the people that being involved in this drama production, i cried, i laughed and i got angry to the point that i threw my ipad to the floor and the screen is blank now well anyway it is really addicting to binge it\\'s almost like a drug....mm drugma?? (drug-drama) lol SUCH a good drama! I really cannot understand why more people aren\\'t watching. If you\\'re a fan of the \\'slice of life\\' genre, give this a try! I really dont know why people are hating on this drama so much, personally I am really enjoying it. The episode where the women start to dance in the rain like in a bacchanalia (after a divorce party) is cringe as hell. This drama is terrible. Anything with Cha Taehyun is great to me. Unabashedly a super fan here! I see Seo Janghoon inside Cha Taehyun role in this drama lol @northerngirl This is one of the finest dramas. I think there is a misunderstanding of the main character...he is kind but has very little self-knowledge. But he is slowly coming to a greater understanding of himself and what relationships are. Hello! can anybody please tell me the title of the song in episode 11-12 (40:46)? Thanks in advance! This writer has to be feminist lol. I was a fan of the drama before ep 6. I liked the dialogues and how it touched so many aspects irl. But then it was ruined by the divorce party. I never liked that grandma character, she\\'s old and calm but she doesn\\'t have wisdom every grandmother should have, she\\'s most annoying character ever, and the time she pulled out the cigarette omg i really hate that face. And the writer is really making the males in this drama to be losers lol like what the hell do you want from pointing that out? I maybe need to check the original drama, bc i\\'m dissapointed with korean version. Sorry papa Cha, i\\'ll support your next projects! So far I\\'m not a fan of this adaptation. They\\'re making the husband a pathetic loser whom everyone laughs at. The wife has almost no flaws other than being a little clumsy. The original drama was more realistic in this sense. The only thing I\\'m looking forward in this drama is the lesbian romance between the wife\\'s sister and her colleague. Somebody know whats the song in episode 3-4 21\\':50\" that whee roo sing with Ending eps 8 make me cry. Bae Doona is great actress. Quality drama??? the actors are great❤️ I watch this drama because of Cha Taehyun.? I watched this because of cha taehyun. I like these types of dramas about marriage. However there was no connection with his partner. No chemistry at all. I was cringing the whole time I watched her. Hope they chose another actress for the role. On the fourth ep and this drama is giving me all the feelings. Bae Doona is an astounding actress, and her pairing with Cha Tae Hyun is great. On the fourth episode and bawling my eyes out because of how well she can draw in my sympathy from her smallest actions of hurt. Absolutely loving it! A really special drama with great acting and writing! A nice break from run of the mill rom-coms. This drama is a little unjust with the male characters. The sister\\'s boyfriend is left without any apparent reason and even accused of sexual assault. The husband is left by his ex and wished by her that he should just die because he made innocent jokes about a shark and terrible music lyrics without having any idea that her father was killed by a shark (I\\'m not kidding). This adaptation of the japanese drama seems a little off to me. @ya: it\\'s ost part 2 by We Ha Jun @ya: Like being hit by a bullet - Baek Ji Young Somebody know whats the song when whee roo on the club with her friends, a man sing this song before last scene of episode 4 Thank you Ending ep. 1 make my tears drop like river Cha Tae-hyun is a great actor and have marvelous comic timing but I\\'m hating the character he\\'s playing. What a petty person. But I guess that\\'s the point of the drama. I just hope it doesn\\'t end like the original one ended. Watched it because of Cha Taehyun oppa! And I can\\'t wait for the next episode!! ❤❤❤ KBS drama but feels like TVN drama, great story slice of life. Haven\\'t seen it yet but plan to. Both the leads are big names, and I especially have huge expectations from Bae Doona a very brilliant actress. Cha Tae Hyun!!! He is all I need to follow this drama! Cha tae hyun is the best actor in korea. Been watching him since my sassy girl. I just watched ep. 1 and 2. It feels so real about marriage life. I got teary because last minute of ep 2. It so hurts TT Looking forward to this drama. Definitely will follow this drama till end. Watching you always... Cha Tae Hyun... from Phillipines with love... Really excited about this i really like cha tae hyun ... i\\'ve been watching his movies over and over again ... mostly when i\\'m down .... he always make me feel better... Uhmmm.... *sent from Eita\\'s phone People should not underestimate Cha Tae Hyun. He is a great actor and he has starred in box office hits like My Sassy girl and Scandel makers and also he is one of the richest actors in Korea. Script and Leading Actresses are great and my style but this time first male???? The trailer; storyline and casting is promising to be a must watch on my K drama list. I’m a fan of Chae Tae Hyun; Bae Doo Na and Lee El so it’s not surprising that the Director chose his cast well; Thank you for that. So looking forward to some early week rom com frivolity. Can’t wait! I can say that Chae Tae Hyun is OG so to those that only know of his recent works and variety shows he’s been around since year dot and his lead in My Sassy Girl 2001 is one of my most memorable impressions of him along with his cameo appearance in Steal my Heart. Must watch. As a big fans of Cha Tae Hyun i feel sad and irritated with everyone who underestimated him here.. if you have only saw producer and the best hit or only knew him from variety shows please don\\'t say any ignorant things.. he\\'s one of A class actor in Korea, i know his projects wasn\\'t really well known internationally but he can pull of any character.. so please watch the drama first and judge after that.. and if you don\\'t know he\\'s also played a character in along with the gods: The two worlds.. I\\'m so excited to watch this drama but it\\'s on kbs2 mon/tue which means it\\'ll have low rating no matter how good it will be:( So excited for this drama.Love the cast <3 OMG Bae Doo Na and Son Seok Koo OMG Sense8 feels I wish they are both the lead in this drama omg~! The storyline is different from the original, and yes i miss eita playing his character as mitsuo in saikou no rikon LOL... i\\'m always love to watch cha tae hyun acting, he is on of the very talented actor ~ why not him? from the synopsis the character really suit him. off-cos sense8 couple was happen to cast in this project (i do love this couple too). so i\\'m still excited because all four of them is my favorite are gather that happen to rock this drama.so just support this drama guys! can\\'t wait!!!! Cannot wait!!!!!, Even more because of Cha Tae-Hyun!!!!!! This drama will be simply amazing!!!! Love Bae Doo Na., but, why Cha Ta Hyun? He just into variety show. CHA TAE HYUUN <3 <3 <3 can\\'t wait!! I love Bae Doo Na and Lee El... The lead male I only remember well from The Best Hit (ironic to go onto the best divorce lol) and wayyy back in (1999) Into the Sunlight (Jang Hyuk/Kim Hyun Joo/Kim Ha Neul all adorable in their youth) as dramas go though he was super in Along w/the Gods (amazing film)... Firstly, i LOVE Saikou no Rikon. Eita did a really great job in that drama. I will watch this if eita makes a cameo Sorry but when it comes to acting cha tae hyun is no eita can the sense8 couple just be together lmao I can\\'t believe Detective Mun and Sun aren\\'t a couple in this drama??? Damn, what a cast! So excited. Luv u cha taehyun...excited for this drama..lots of luv frm Nepal I LOVE the Japanese version! Now I can\\'t wait for the Korean version. Not sure I just watched let\\'s hold hands and watch the sunset which is has a similar storyline and it was as good as I waited it to be It\\'s the best Japanese drama I have seen. I hope the Koreans will do it justice. IT\\'S A YASSS. It\\'d be wonderful, ik ik. Aw nevermind about the lead couple, can we get a ship between Bae Doo-Na and Son Seok-Koo again?! WE NEED MORE OF IT. I\\'m afraid with Korean\\'s interpretation about this drama. Because it\\'s a Sakamoto Yuji\\'s script! But somehow i relieves that it will be played by Bae Doo Na and Cha Tae Hyun Gianna jun please',\n",

       "  'comments': 'I very\" like this drama I really like the natural story. Their first meeting, or even how the teacher realized the feeling after some eps. It was really normal to have love with whoever no matter how old the person is. If many people said the pedhophil thing, they must haven\\'t seen till the end. The teacher never abuse or did wrong sexually to the student. Honestly, I feel so sad, when the drama suddenly ends. this drama make me interested at first I saw it in youtube. There\\'s a lot of fan made video that why I\\'m curious about this. The theme of this is very exciting and interested. I\\'m also a teacher so I know the hard work of Hijiri to make her student in a right path and I also I salute Akira for his true love for Hijiri. I really love this drama this is my first time to watch a Japanese Drama and I love it! I really love ❤️ this drama.It makes me moved to tears. Love is no borders. Love is meaning to everyone. It doesn’t distinguish between right or wrong. If the teacher?\\u200d? n her student?\\u200d? found their true love,why do we separate them??? I was a teacher and I had some male students who liked me. At that time, I was strong enough not to attract by my students. Sometimes, I feel sympathy with my students. For my old students at college of nature and science in Ho Chi Minh city in Vietnam. I still miss you!? I\\'m Totally In Love With This Doramaaaa!!!! the manga probably won\\'t end the same way since it\\'s ongoing, and hijiri hasn\\'t reciprocated akira\\'s feelings yet either A lot of people call this drama pedophile and disgusting but you can\\'t ever say these things to this drama before watching it. It\\'s true, as an adult we have a responsibility especially when we\\'re wrong. Everybody have mistake, Nobody is perfect. Imagine a teacher dating your younger brother. Creepy like hell. Even if it\\'s just a story. @rrr , are we watching the same drama? did you see how she try to push him away? and leaving him? As a high school teacher with somewhat of a similar experience from a student I find this drama creepy. The moment my student showed any interest I shot him down with ignorance and disinterest. He got the message and never let it continue. I even reprimanded him when he tried to find out where i lived. He understood that I don\\'t approve stalking. As an adult, especially as a teacher it\\'s our duty to draw the line so the we can learn from it. This movie makes me so curious every episodes. I wait for the end of this story in the last episode. Honestly everyone should watch this. It is not just a fanservice student-teacher romance but it is highly realistic. And the characters are well written too. Akira is the perfect portrayal of a teenager with rebellious, stubborn, confuse, clingy etc. Hijiri is perfect too and you will understand later how she fell for akira. Besides that, shotaro and haraguchi are the perfect character addition to this drama. They aren\\'t simply exist just to serve the main plot but they also have their own story. I can ensure that you will end up care about the four main characters instead of the hero/heroin only. addicted, its hard to survive the wait for new episodes definitely my most guilty pleasure to date.... dying for episode 6 I am excited to watch the full episodes and I like it. people should learn how to widen their minds. if it\\'s love, let it be. the more they go against it, the more problem it creates. besides, it\\'s not like he\\'s going to be a child forever. Before I watched I think this drama similar with majo no joken and stereotipe like other love strories in jdrama. But after ep 1 i really...really touching with the story, background music and plot. love it @Anna I totally agree with you this drama is brilliant! Episode 5 was so good I cannot wait for episode 6 to come out and this waiting game is killing me This is an excellent drama! Don’t let the age part of this drama fool you. I do think it is intentional to give us the sense of tragedy. Episode 5 marks the end of the first chapter and starting from episode 6, Akira will be 18, so let’s see how this goes! very excited for next week I read online that the relationship will start when he\\'s 17, so what\\'s your worry? @Arni Really majo no jouken was an excellent drama. Although that ending scene I can\\'t understand what happened. I even searched some japanese websites but nothing.Anyways I recommend majo no jouken to everyone it is such a great drama. The drama is actually really really good. Too bad it isn\\'t getting a good reception in Japan, mostly because of the story\\'s premise concerning the age gap between the teacher and her student. I do feel like they should have aged the student slightly from the manga and made him 17 instead. However, there have been plenty of Japanese dramas and movies that have to do with a teacher/student forbidden relationship kind of genre and they are almost all male teachers and female students. I don\\'t see why they\\'re having a hard time with the subject matter now that it is a female teacher and a male student. I personally am really enjoying the drama and I like the way the story is unfolding. It\\'s being handled tastefully and it\\'s nowhere near as creepy as other Japanese dramas/movies I\\'ve seen with the same subject matter. I highly recommend watching it because the dynamic between the leads is amazing. The cinematography and music in the drama also really sets the vibe. Love so much the drama.. Is it really came from the Manga from 2013? Why do I have the feeling that this is a remake of Jdorama Majo No Jouken from 1996? it is one of my fave JDorama.Anyways i\\'ll still give this a shot.im sure there\\'s still something more in here.BTW Majo no Jouken is a must watch drama.after you seen it, Im sure you\\'ll know what Im talking about the similarity in these two dramas. The first episode is good, looks promising.',\n",

       "  'comments': \"Loved This Drama!!! I've watched many many of them and this one is the King Emperor of the lot! So sweet and funny and cute! The romance feels real, the squirrels are adorable and Oh I wish I'd had a teacher like him!! Excellent drama Its your usual slice of life, drama, comedy and feel good drama. Recommended 11/10! Stress reliever and will make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside:) I wish this series have second season, which is rare. i want more story between Mizumoto-sensei and Aikawa-san more deeply:D this dorama is a must watch for those who like comedy and drama. human drama actually, but not that deep. a little bit romance, but nothing heavy. this drama inspired me so much on how to make myself be better than before, love myself more, etc. Aikawa sensei is an interesting character!! Tbh I recommend this drama to anyone! The themesong is sung by SUPER BEAVER and is called Yukan 予感. I love the opening theme song...anyone know who sing the song and title, please?... I like the theme song very much, does anyone knows what is the title? Honestly I like this drama since the first episode, it has a good vibe. And when i watched the 2nd, 3rd, so on, this become one of my favorite jdrama. I hope it'll also has good ending. this one!!!! So deep!!! I gave good rating for this drama. You can learn much about animals & plants by Kazuki's teaching. It's like studying biology in term of drama. The way they shot the film is bright, at least not much filter as common dorama. The lead couples met in a weird situation and they had their own story without much interference. It seems slow, but surely relatable to everyday's life. The way Kazuki came late to doctor Ikumi's clinic, broke his promise, was obviously how otaku would do. Only to complete his bones figurine! Was laughing at how stupid but genius Kazuki could be.\",\n",

       "  'comments': 'i liked this drama 7.5 out of 10 with good recommendations the drama effectively ended when the wicked mom was caught after so many close calls tried and put in prison but i think this drama was wrote for more epi but due to the low ratings they kill it by epi 80 common maneuver when the ads revenue can not cover the huge production costs so instead of losing more money they just stop the bleading by killing it I enjoyed this drama a lot!!!!! Really aptly named, what a healing drama, my buddy my tears accompanied me all along til the last episode. I usually don\\'t comment, but this is the best family drama I have ever watched. I normally skip some scenes since there too many characters that I don\\'t like - but not on this one. No replacement for this drama from MBC? finished epi 76 once again chiyuya the long lost daughter was stunningly majestic beautiful in that black gown i think ill faint if i see her in person dressd like that one more weekend to go and this will be it the ratings were kind of low to me tho the time slot was prime time hope to see more of so yujina in another drama I think this drama is good. If you don’t want to pay child support don’t have sex. Parents should both raise the child weather they are in relationship or not. They can be married to others but be in your kids life. I think this drama is interesting... Like \"m\", I can\\'t stand Eun-Joo!!! She\\'s, a real slug. I hate these type of women. She got pregnant to have a roof over her head, to be fed and to force herself into the guy\\'s life. Knowing perfectly well that he wants nothing to do with her. I can\\'t stand her pathetic and intrusive character either. She wanted a child? Fine. Then she should deal with it on her own. That\\'s her responsibility not his. Law is wrong to oblige guys to take responsibility for women who do that. Badmouthing your long lost granddaughter.... how cliche. LOL finished epi 52 chiuna was majestic beautiful at the introduction of the long sought grandaughter heir of grandma company her dress was really beautiful like cinderella before midnight Here we go......back n toward then backward again....typical long drama...,interesting part would be only 2 last episode What is wrong with Yang Eun-Joo!!! So she got pregnant! Shows up at 9months pregnant and excepts the guy and his family to embrace and take her in. I think thats REALLY MANIPULATIVE!! He want s NOTHING to do with her what she begs and hangs on. I REALLY CAN\\'T STAND HER PATHETIC character. Lawyer, sign the papers and let that creature to leave forever. Please don\\'t continue to torment me with her presence. A woman should be twice more careful because she is the one who gets pregnant, not the man. In the end, she will be the one who will bear the consequences in a way or in other. When this annoying character was hospitalised, she told to ICW that she loves JS. That\\'s why I think her pregnancy could be premeditated. Maybe not, but her subsequent behaviour demonstrates this. The guy left home because he did not wish to see her at all. And what is she doing? She goes to his office and presents herself as a member of his family. Then she goes to his apartment and gets inside without his permission. She is an annoying leech. When he tells her to disappear and to leave him alone she approaches to him more and more. He categorically is a bad guy but, her behaviour makes me be on his side. And please don\\'t try to blame him more than is worth, because some of his actions are a countermeasure to his family actions or have nothing to do with the relations between him and that leech. Did Park Jeon-Seung or his mother do a test to see if Eun Joo is his baby???? She is just relentless and pushy. If the baby is his, he is responsible for the baby, but not Eun Joo. How did she find out where they moved to?????? @sf So this guy has no fault whatsoever. In my comment I said they BOTH should have taken measures not to get pregnant. He treated her nicely when they were together and then after she got pregnant he threw her away and tried to make her get an abortion. Then after that, he tried to make her leave the country. Men who are getting used for child support should also be careful in this day and age because it is horrible what SOME women are doing ... using their children as paychecks but this girl didn\\'t get pregnant to get money out of him. His responsibility is to the child but why does he have the right to discard her like she was nothing. He was present when this child was made. He needs to step up. Please explain to me which part of his actions was right? Getting her pregnant? Trying to force her into having an abortion? Trying to defraud another family into marriage using lies? Trying to force his sister in law to take her to the Philippines where she won\\'t see her family? Which part of these things was correct? She shouldn\\'t force herself on him yes that part I hate and I find her delusional for thinking he should marry her so she can show off their marriage and baby to her family but please do tell. What has he done that is so right? Plus why should a woman be twice more careful in a relationship? i only watched so yujin in 2 other dramas seoul 1945 and five enough she was superb in both so i became a big fan from time to time i was looking for her other dramas but couldnt find any until this one which was a very pleasant surprise for me just finished epi 6 and the story line looks interesting a bit confusing cuz it just started and there are lots of incognitas that will be solved as we go along she is not really pretty or very sexy like all other lead females which i think its becoming a standard in kdramas she is there cuz her superb acting skills are second to none fightiiiiiiiii so yujina They Will be step sister and step brother but remember that jeong hun calls yoong who (his father or rather step father) ajhussi when he is young so chi woo and jeong hun aren\\'t blood related at all. The story .... so complicated... so many up s and down talking ... the lead actress lack of acting .. no emotional ... she doesnt have confidence.... her role is annoying.... i like her but the role ...No Guts.... so boring. not realistic. the lead actress should divorce her husband the soonest possible time. so irritating. no wonder the ratings are poor. I decided to continue watching this series because of choi yi yoo and Im joo cheol romance @Zee. I think you are joking. And what she has done is not an abuse, forcing him to take her in his house and marry her? Being a woman you should be twice more careful in a relationship with a man. Why blame him because she has nowhere to go or to live? He has no obligation to her, only for the child. He can help her because of his child but, from a distance. I hate the women who are using their child as a weapon against the man, to marry them against the man\\'s will. Any criminal is condemned for a period of time, after that he is free. To marry someone whom you do not want is a punishment for life and this is not fair. @sf are you serious or did you skip parts of the story.... the guy who slept with her got her pregnant and then took her to get an abortion. When it comes to women having your pregnancy terminated against your will is something you can never get over and that is abuse. If he didn\\'t want a child with her they BOTH should have taken the necessary measures not to get pregnant. It is his child so he should accept it and look after the child... she has nowhere to go and he is busy denying her and making plans to marry another woman. Come on. Yang Eun-Joo character is too annoying. She is a nobody, who got pregnant and after nine months appears in front of her child\\'s father to tell him that he will be a father and he must accept her and their child. Is this woman sane? I hope this character will quickly disappear from the picture. This drama doesn\\'t feel like Five Enough at all. Only 2 characters stand out in this family drama: Im Chi-Woo and Choi Jin-Yoo. I love the actors playing them. But we saw them almost non-stop in the first episodes. We already got to see how they first met, and one of them is already deeply in love with the other. I\\'m not sure if there is anything else left to see. Are the creators really thinking of filling 80 episodes with a love story? I watched the episode 4 and I\\'m still waiting for Hwang Sun Hee\\'s appearance. @mona Feels like Five Enough but I want to watch because of Yeon Jeong hun The first two episodes were very annoying. Chi-woo should\\'ve just speak here mind to her husband. Like why would you live like that for 8 years? The first episode is really enjoyable verry bright seems promising. @mona So she will get mistreated cheated on and she will get divorced and struggle to keep her kids, ends up falling for a new man similar to her role in Five Enough from two years ago!',\n",

       "  'comments': \"Jesus Christ, how many dorama tropes can you fit in a synopsis and in turn in a drama? As gaijin, thoroughly enjoyed -- MUCH better than US version What are chances for a season 2? Ending of the ep 11 left door open IMHO. I had love to watch more yuto and yuko in romcom drama. Please casting them together again!! They are great in this and bokura no gohan?? great to see 2 reunions in this drama: oda yuji + suzuki honami and nakajima yuto + araki yuko <3 Even I know the story is false, but it is a very interesting drama. So, Yuto Nakajima as Mike and Yuko Araki as Rachel? Perfect cast. Hope for their romance scenes ^.^ Yuto Nakajima as Mike and Yuko Araki as Rachel? It's good to watch them together again after Bokugoha wowwww oda yuji and honami suzuki reunite again after tokyo love story Glad to see Yuto Nakajima and Yuko Araki act together again >.< so excited to see nakajima yuto and araki yuko acting together again? boy, Yuto! I am proud.\",\n",

       "  'comments': 'Not entirely the same, but gives me the same feeling as Midnight Diner. Binged this over the weekend. Love it. Hi @hotarumaruchii, Thank you @FeKimi and @hotarumaruchii for your views on the episodes. I ended up watching without subs and dying to know what is due for Kosei at end of November (bakudan? I google translate it into bomb??) And that lots of money that Kosei had. I am clueless about that too.. but had a gist about it being related to a family member? I wish a fansub team picks up this drama (-,-) Hi! @FeKimi thank you for your comment & thoughts about Ryuhei Matsuda, I appreciate it ^^ Hi @Zzz, @Fekimi: Can you please tell me what episode was Akira\\'s humming? matsuda ryohei is an awkward guy. but he delivers in all his movies and dramas. it\\'s his trademark. and he complements well with all his leading ladies,, ha! i lurve the drama theme, and akira-san, i too want to fall in love with someone, just like how you feeling. marriage blues:D Hai Hotarumaruchii, hello! friends; update: I\\'m still watching this despite the big turned down of ratings last week but yesterday\\'s episode actually caught the ratings again on track. There are times that I think some content & pacing are slow & dull, the characters conflict somehow a bit force to impose & the monotone of events really wears you off; I haven\\'t watched a lot of films/shows from Ryuhei Matsuda but is he usually like that? awkward, blunt, not too expressive? or is he just really good in acting awkward for his character since his character is supposed to be like that but his awkward vibe has that attraction, I\\'m not asking in a rude way I actually root his character Kosei to end up with Gakky\\'s character Akira, yes the unlikeable pair ^^yesterday\\'s episode trended in Japan that I guess it reflects to the ratings that put them back on track again, I hope after yesterday\\'s episode, the story will catch up with interesting developments between the leads & supporting characters. I don\\'t know how many episodes this drama is but mehn this will take you patience to see the turning point of events lol Skip this series. This is one of those \"being weird for weird\\'s sake\\'. No story and whenever Matsuda Ryuhei is on it\\'s like looking at a black hole, no talent, no charisma, no talent just a monotone performance. I love to watch Aragaki Yui but in this series I can\\'t bear to watch. I am so hooked with this dorama right now!! I\\'m in for Gakky and Inukai. As expected from Nogi Akiko, the story is good so far. I\\'m currently watching this; so far I\\'m liking it. I guess there will be some who won\\'t be hook on the first ep because the story still in the process of revealing things, they take things slowly, especially in ryuhei\\'s character because of that ep.3 teaser might probably others too. The story seems more focus on the lives of Akira & Kosei with their work, how they handle their stresses, love and personal life where they go to this bar drinking away their problems/stresses connects them somehow. Ryuhei kun daisuki desu.❤️❤️❤️ Yay:-) new drama from Gakky...I like Matsuda Ryohei, perhaps he is not as handsome as some other actors, but he gives warm vibe somehow. i guess this is their reunion after the movie long time ago. MUST WATCH... uwaa gakky looks sexy Yui Aragaki and Ryuhei Matsuda\\'s reunion but in a drama ommmgg these two are my favorites, they just released a teaser poster for this drama and im excited, i\\'m looking forward to it ^^ Omg 2 my fav actors in 1 drama... Cannot wait.. Sigh it\\'s in Oktober.. I hope once it\\'s out the sub will come out faster too My god! I watched their movie tokyo serendipity a few year\\'s ago because i\\'m a fan of both actors and they have such great chemistry. Can\\'t wait for this drama. I\\'ve been waiting for another team up from these two. I think Matsuda would be outstanding even in a toilet paper ad... oh yas Gakky. whatever your drama is, of course im in. NEW GAKKY DRAMA!!? cnt wait..... sugoii So apparently it\\'s gonna be a love story? I love Gakky and this screenwriter so I\\'m definitely watching. But I\\'m still waiting for Gakky x Yamapi\\'s romance drama asdjddfjd WHY CAN\\'T JAPAN DO IT?!',\n",

       "  'comments': 'I love the two main characters. The story was simple, hoping for a better drama story on their next team up? P.o was in the opening credits for all episodes but his character was nowhere to be seen A lot of fluff in this drama....and why were the brother and best friend missing in the last scene. Eun Hye was adorable as usual but Jung Myung seemed to be uninspired...to bad because I have always loved him. He looked like Grandma applied his makeup too. ..? 7 out of 10 for me. Ok.. I love the two main leads... Eun hye since princess hours and coffee prince and lie to me.. I even watched her my fair lady which is to me my least fave among the 4...jung myung on the other hand i\\'ve come to love from his heart to heart stint... So i adore these 2..thus im so excited that they will team up... Prior watching this o saw most negative comments.. But still i bravely watched it.. It was an ok drama.. That i agrees to most of the comments was a wasted storyline and execution.. Yeah the theme is quite common but i do believe with a powerhouse leads and proper direction and storytelling it could still stand out... Unfortunately this drama failed to do that... Eun hye acting is so natural while jung myung bere is kinda off acting.. Far away from his performance in heart to heart thta you can feel how he is deeply in love with the female lead.. Here i dont feel anything between the two.. I dunno.. It is just a so so drama.. Dont even recommend it to watch.. I\\'ve watched 178 korean dramas... And i will tell you this is on my almost bottom rank... So sad for the two main leads.. Their talent wasn\\'t maximize...it was a wasted comeback of eun hye.. The main couple has great chemistry but the script wasnt good enough to bring out the best in them. No doubt we all know tht both actors are great actors! they could act really well, i really wish there will be another project for both of them. Pls be a couple again in the next kdrama! A romantic comedy is best for this couple! Pls pls! I\\'m on episode 6 and I love the chemistry between Woo Hyun & Yoo Jung. Probably my favorite kdrama this 2018 The writing for this drama is trash I’m looking at the actors/characters individual performances only which was great I hope the leads star in another drama together its a stain in their catalog. I’m happy to see Yoon Eun-Hye back but this drama was not the comeback drama This drama started out very good, with a great storyline. I can\\'t tell if the subpar writing resulted in laziness because of poor ratings. It seemed to take a turn for the worse at the end of the drama. Love this kdrama. Great chemistry between CJM and YEH. Their acting are very consistent and matches so well. It did get my heart fluttering moments. Hope to see more projects from both of them! love the starting... but the ending was draggy. get the verge of getting boring. There\\'s no ups and downs about this show. Waste of time! WoW! No regrets! I super LOVE the ending! It has redeemed the boring episodes. The good things about Fluttering Warning: i thought the third charm was already the worst, this drama is worse. The two leads are amazing, cute....they could\\'ve done better if they had a better script..There is a hidden chemistry between them! But unfortunately, it was crushed with the bad/script ... It was like the writers are in some kind of coma...I really want to see these talented actors in another well written drama:) Please I think this drama is so wonderful, the chemistry between of Them (yeh n Cjm) are like real. and I have been watching until episode of 15. this is like the real proposal between cjm 2 yeh?hahahaha. I don\\'t care if there is no much kiss. Because I think hug is more make my heart fluttering. If there are too many kiss scenes, that is very boring and only based on desire. This drama doesn\\'t seem serious, in my opinion. Too bad the storyline sucks af with such great lineup of actors? I was cringing the whole time but I kept on watching it anyways?? theres like big hole here in there along the storyline that it just hurt to watch? YEH drama usually doesnt dissapoint but this one is just too bad?? I’m a big fan of both leads tbh this drama was a waste for them this drama storyline they can act in their sleep I loved their chemistry I hope they star in another drama together as the leads. The leads for this drama should’ve been rookie actors (Their 1st project) or actors on the rise (The Underrated supporting actors). Cant korea drama be more creative in making story line? So predictable and seems like they will keep the same flow forever. Getting worst in ep 10, 11, and 12. Story moving an inch for each episode. Flash back for mostly half of the time. I even can catch up by skipping and finishing an ep for 10 mins. The cast other than eun hye is so amateur. This movie from 1-10, I give 3! Omgness! The story is going in circle between Hae Joo and Woo Hyun’s dialogue (five times meeting her)...” Hae Joo ya you can stop now “, lol. He’s not even doing anything to stop her!?!?!? And where is the step mom supposedly going to help him win against Woo Hyun? WTH!!!! I love watching k drama but I want more romance between chun Jung myung and eun yoon hye have a chemistry of two of them I hope in real life became a boyfriend is a perfect match. I love both Yoon Eun-Hye and Chun Jung-Myung but the storyline sucks. I wish Chun Jung-Myung didn\\'t turned down Coffee Prince with Yoon Eun-Hye back then. Would love to see more of their romance, but ep. 11 and 12 are a complete waste. The rating is does\\'nt matter,,the important is the lead actress and actor also the other cast,,,both of them are popular,,nothing change that tittle,,,i enjoying to watch this drama,,eun hye still pretty untill now,,i like her,,also the lead actor...im waiting untill end of drama,,..glad to see again ms YEH on screen,,we missed you so much,,,go..go... go...Godbless.. I was really enjoying the drama at the beginning. I\\'m a big fan of YEH and have seen a couple of CJM works but I couldn\\'t finish this drama. Too many things I dislike. From the desperate crazy second lead girl, to the mom faking cancer, the amount of scene of YEH exercising. I hate the fact that second guy had to pretend he was gay just to befriend YEH. Him and P.O barely had any scene too. It\\'s hard to believe that PO was the brother, he felt more like a manager. Or that YEH was an top actress in the drama. All the characters are lacking and so is the storyline. Only likeable person was manager HJK. I think the script writter screw up this dramma. And the production is not good neither. I feel so sorry for YEH and CJM. They are very good actors. But whats happening from ep 10-11 make lower rating. Is it really rom com drama? My top ongoing drama.I fell for Chun Jung Myung even more?such a great actor and he is so cute??.I love him since Cinderella\\'s Stepsister.Yoon Eun hye of course is no doubt a great actress and I love their chemistry??.More projects for both in the future I\\'ll be rooting for you guys infact Im planning to binge watch heart to heart of Jung Myung and Choi Kang Hee after Fluttering Warning???.Fighting??..Lots of love from PH?? poor cinematography, poor audio (so many overlapping audio), poor video transition.. it\\'s make me sad that eun hye comeback (my fave actress) with this \"low-budget\" drama:( I love Yoon Eun after watching \"I miss you\". I love this drama, great actors . I decided to watch thus drama because Yoon Eun is my favourite korean actress. This is first time I watch actor Chun Jung so I am impressed about his charismatic acting . I think I will look up and watch his other dramas. i love this drama Love it?? I love the main couple. They are experience actors. It’s the unknown director that makes them look bad. some scenes are plain lame. One scene where the Brother and reporter were eating ramen at convenient store. The camera were at many angles but the moments were not mashing up. I don\\'t care about the ratings!!! i enjoyed watching this drama and looking forward to watching the remaining episodes! Fighting Yoon Eun Hye & Chun Jung Myung! You both did a good job!??? I love this drama.. good chemistry between the two lead actor and actress.. I like the story.. go. go. go.. Yoon Eun-Hye …. go… go.. go… Chun Jung-Myung i love the series so much it has wonderful conflicts. i love the leading man also. he\\'s cute Even that the rating is low, I still love this drama! Yoon Eun Hye Fighting me too! i so love this drama. I like this drama,even that the rating was law Loving the woo-yoo couple, nice casting full of chemistry, plz be real Yeàhh the rating it dosn\\'t matter. I enjoying watch this drama. Always waiting for the next episode..#fighting from indonesia? Love it too... wonder why ratings are low ☹️ No matter what the rating says, it doesnt matter, as long as most of us viewers are happy and enjoying the series. Enjoying this kdrama so far. Great pairing and amazing chemistry from both leads. So many heart-fluttering moments. CJM and YEH really nail the character well. I really love this kdrama. ❤ They have great chemistry. Even the soundtracks are wonderful to listen to. Am always looking forward to the next episode.? I love this drama. Waiting for the next episode. i love this kdrama <3 i love yoon eun hye <3 and i\\'m goin to love the leading man chung jung myung ... nice chemistry both of them.. I love Yoon Eun-Hye alot.. one of my favorite actress ever.. im so excited for this drama.. weekly - exciting and waiting for next episode. regardless of the storyline and OST - This is Yoon Eun Hye so its a MUST WATCH for me:) . Done watching episode 6.. So far love the plot goes..Kudos to everybody..Fighting.#lovealert I really love this drama. I\\'m gonna ship this couple, love the chemistry and how they act in the drama. I love you Yoon Eun Hye ❤? You\\'re my No. 1 fave Actress in Korea. You\\'re so Pretty and talented!?? This may have the generic type of storyline BUT the overall drama is so freaking good!!! Lead actors chemistry is so great that I\\'m really hooked. How is it that eyh\\'s looks didnt change that much since coffee prince? Still so pretty. And i love cjm since foxy lady.. Nice drama. Though, it\\'s easy to predict the plot. I\\'m enjoying the drama. It\\'s cliche but worth it. The main couple is so cute and I\\'m loving the characters. Hope they keep it up. Fighting! I have been waiting for yoon eun hye drama..i watched all her drama and i believe she is one of the best actress in south korea. I really love it, eun hye Yoon is back after a very long time she has a new k drama again. Wow:-) I super love you unni! So glad to watch Eun Yeh on tv drama again. I hope this would make her more visible again in kdramas. She\\'s talented and well-loved by viewers all over th world. We always support you the queen of drama YEH. Still beautiful as always and your acting very impressive and no doubt about that. This drama fits for you to comeback. And I’m falling in love for this dramaaaa??? Love the episode 2 and 3 so far,,, hopefully more twist and the plot is good so far..hurray for ep. 4 and 5..Fighting I super duper love this drama, especially the acting skills of Yoon Eun Hye and Chun Jung myung. Thankyou Unnie for coming back in a drama, i waited this for so long, and now its a wish granted. You\\'re my no. 1 favorite actress in Korea. Fighting Unnie!???? more movies and dramas for you coz you\\'re very good in terms of acting skills. Saranghae ❤ i will support you always.? I really love this Drama! ahhhh WooYoo Couple ❤️️❤️️ @Jung Wi, I don\\'t like the plot either, it\\'s cliché but since this is based on web drama so I give it a pass. I will just enjoy YEH and Chun Jung Myung acting then. The power yoo eun hye. She prove it. The highest rating in MBN eventhougt with low budget. YG Entertaiment please more effort and more budget, is still running right? it will be success. She still have a lot fan who lov and support her. And she is really good actress I dropped watching other drama for this one. At first, I was thinking that it’s another contract marriage Plot. However, I like how the storyline go so far. There is another twist and turn that will hook you to keep on watching. I’m not familiar with the lead actor and not really a big fan of Eun Hye, but they made the drama worth watching. The plot is voery unoriginal, almost generic. Contract to make it seem like they are in love...like ne of her past drama\\'s Lie to Me or even The Prime minister and I. I love Chun Jung Myung great in almost everything he has done but this plot line has been done too many times. Wow is great,,nice drama,,yoon eun hye, still the same nothing change your image even though older ur age,but still pretty,, younger than ur age,,in fact only songhyekyo ilike but when i watch ur kdrama start from goong,coffee prince,and more...i like ur charisma,ur acting is real,..then ur new drama im so happy to watch of this with the leading actor,both of you ur the best...i llike you eunhye bcoz ur cheerful and pretty ..good luck.... .I\\'m enjoy watching this until finish,,..Godbless... is it just me? but Joo Woo-Jae looks like sandeul of B1A4 I\\'m loving it! Both actor n actress showed a great chemistry. Welcome back Yoo Eun Hye unni? YAY!!! So happy Yoon Eun-Hye is back!!! Enjoying this drama so far. Definitely a lighthearted rom/com which I love. The storyline isn’t anything original but I still love it! The two main leads have great chemistry! Looking forward to the next episode! idol Yoon Eun Hye its back Love it so far. Will keep on watching. Welcome back. I love the two episodes so far, welcome back! I am really happy she is back. I truly missed her. I want her to know that we all support her ❤️ A typical RomCom set up couple but it made me happy. Yoon Eun Hye acting is really at par. She can twist or make something out of ordinary story line. (my opinion alone) I like the 2 epi so far and I am looking forward to the coming episodes. I only recognize yoon eun hye only and this drama is cliche. But i like it. Will keep watching. Welcome back yes eun hye yoon my idol is back welcome back eun hye yoon we ve missed u so much <3 <3 <3 <3 Another “Lie To Me” of Yoon Eun-Hye...love it so far:) Another cliche contract relationship. Count me in!!!! Welcome back Unnie!!!YEH i waited for you from the past few years to make a new kdrama. You are always be my no.1 favorite actress in korean actresses...Hoping that this series will be a big hit for you..Thanks for your superb acting as always. ...I am beyond excited to watch this!!! chinchaaa Episode one is promising so far. I\\'m glad Unnie Eun Hye is back! Just like in the story, she\\'s a Fairy of a Goddess in the Kdrama world. Welcome back! Any project from YEH is welcome and deeply appreciated, I really missed seeing you on the screen. Welcome back!!! Then they actually fall in love like the two main in “the beauty inside”? Omooo! The Queen is back! Go unnie! You still act Great! Love u! ❤ So good she is back she is one of my fav actresses the story line is kind of like her past drama \" lie to me\" I wanted to see a new side to her role but I hope Although she is not my fav actress, she is one of the Korean stars who have acknowledged Korean dramas to the world. I remember the Goong which is aired in Turkey in 2009 it attracted me that time and it is the first time I was watching Koreans back then and after that in 2013 When I watched BOF, I began following Korean dramas as crazy. Yoon Eun Hye is back! Can\\'t wait to watch this drama I am fan of YEH and CJM. I was just waiting for their work but see what they are coming together. I can’t ask for more. Just waiting for the telecast. The story line reminds me of Lie to Me, also stared by Yoon Eun Hye. I miss her a lot, and it\\'s nice she shows superb acting in teaser! OMG... Yoon Eun Hye is back. It\\'s been a long time, been missing her dramas. Cliche or not, will definitely support her and definitely will watch this drama. YEH, fighting! Welcome back Yoon Eun Hye is just wonderful to see you again , knowing your work Iam sure the series will be a successful project. Wishing you the best of all the world won\\'t be enough because you have the universe with you, God bless you and your whole family. Great to have you back Yoon Eun Hye, some actresses who stars in dramas nowadays doesn\\'t interests me. Hope to see more dramas from you. Welcome back! Im so excited for this?? Excited for this.I\\'m a Yoon Eun Hye Fan and I love Chun Jung Myung in cinderella\\'s Stepsister and seeing them as an on screen pair will be heaven..????cant wait.I dont care if it\\'s cliche anyway almost every drama is.It depends on the cast and how they portray their role and this pair will surely doing a great great job plus Choi Jung Won as the second male lead??? I love to see yoon eun hye coming back like this but... tbh the story is really cliche. Finally!!! I\\'m so excited for this!!!! I am SO EXCITED about this upcoming drama! waiting for Yoon Eun Hye! one of my favorite actress! great actress! I\\'m ok with the cast but what\\'s with this already n-time story?! Korean drama writers have lost their creativity! I am SO EXCITED about this upcoming drama!! CJM\\'s last drama wasn\\'t great (not his fault, his acting was impeccable as usual but the script was just nonsensical) so I was waiting for his new drama to get over the disappointment. I\\'ve been waiting FOR YEARS for YEH to appear in a decent drama (last decent one I\\'ve seen her in was \"I miss you\"). I trust that they both picked a great project so I can\\'t wait to enjoy it thoroughly! I really love this pari! Definitely will watch it! They\\'re both great actors and look well together.

       "  'comments': \"If you’re comparing this to season 1 you might not like it, but as an avid reader of the webtoon I feel like this encapsulated a lot of my favorite chapters, especially the projection room/magic show bit with Aebong and Seok Huh.. im not gonna lying this season more to romance than last season... im really disappointed, it should be comedy.. whos ever enjoy this seasons is stupid everyone that said the cast for the s2 were bad , are the haters or maybe they're fans of lks and jsm . To be honest i'm really loves kwang soo and support him in running man or any other programme (i'm his fan) . But to hate the new character isn't an appropriate way . We should accept the reality that the cast changed and give support to yuri and sung hoon . Just be positive and supportive . I have watched all the season , both seasons are great but i do love s2 as there are lots of seok and aebong moments compared to the first one . I can feel the chemistry between the main role . S1 also great as they have lks as the main role since he is a comedian . Honestly the last season was hilarious and Ae bong was not as compulsive as this character here. I feel like she's such a controlling gf in this season. Not letting him hang out cause he spends all the money on it. and all of the other stuff. Like jeez let him have his fun too you stupid character!!!! Just makes me so upset that he cant have his fun. Not gonna watch anymore cause it'll just piss me off. Yuri really fits into the Aebong character & the chemistry between the leads is good too. But I can understand why many people are disappointed with this drama. When a series announces reboot, most people have realllly high expectations but c'mon!!! You cant expect it to be the same as the previous season. I think Kwangsoo more suitable in this lead role . Much better! U fail me Netflix Netflix just ruins every Korean series with its ridiculous reboots. This one isn’t the only one, look at Bad Guys. Why do they need to change the whole cast and keep the same name? Just call it a different name if you have to make a reboot. Oh, and fire all the dumb Netflix managers in charge of Korean dramas, horrible job they’re doing. I'm fans of SOYH on Webtoon, I can said Kwon Yuri really fit Aebong character! I love Jung So Min but Kwon Yuri give me same vibe as Aebongie. She's potrayed Aebong so great, and I feel more chemistry Aebong and Jo Seok right now than previous. Kwon Yuri's definitely not bad actrees. Anyone know the name of the song at the end of ep 10 in season 1 of the reboot? I Felt it was good but not as good as the original one Verry disappointed. I waste my time to watch the 2 episodes of new seasons. Kwang so is the best. lol the casting is so bad along with the acting. The webtoon is supposed to be about an average family and yet they get two pretty faces to play Cho seok and ae bong. Their acting and their appearances don't fit the role at all. Watch until 10 eps, and i was laughing so hard here n there, not that bad like people said about. It’s still give me one hell of entertainment. I think the casts do a great job though. Isn't as good as the first season, but still had some laughs here and there. I couldn't really feel the dynamics in the new cast compared to the old one this drama supposed to be really funny , cute and dumb at the same time, but the cast not that fit the character from the webtoon, it's good but the season 1 or LKS's cast still do better job. i really thought they all did a great job.i was laughing out loud at a lot of it..good job Really Awful, the first season had better actors, better scripts and better direction. I think the new one is funny!!! But perhaps due to its reboot nature, many of us had unattainably high standards.. just give it a chance! It’s really entertaining and the creativity behind it can truly be seen! (Yeah I agree ep1 was quite bad:P) The reboot one is just perfect! All new casts are perfect!! especially Aebong. Kwon Yuri absolutely a better actress than Jung Somin. Who cares about the cuteness??! Dumb people -__- they only want to hate the new casts. Stay salty dumbass fans. The reboot casts lose nothing. Anyways, don't forget to watch season 2 on 3rd december~ uwu All new casts just don't fit at all. Main actor is handsome and cool, so that when he do something weird, funny or stupid, it doesn't feel right. Old Ae Bong is absolutely cuter than the new one. Another member in the family acting like they force to do it. Former casts are irreplaceable. Please stop ruining Sound of your heart.? Season two has big shoes to fill... however they felt very short. It was a big disappointment that they have to change it to new talents.... they are also good but season 1 fits the part better. Wrong move on the part of the management. Sung Hoon can be a handsome man but he's a really bad actor. First Season was a masterpiece, this season is pure trash. I understand that a lot of people say this new season is bad. But I think you have to give it a chance. I didn’t like the first episode because I wasn’t used to the people and the style. I thought I missed my favorite actor Kwang-Soo. He is funny. But when you watch the entire season 2, you will like it too. I’ve laughed a lot, and the cast is awesome. It’s more than just the life of the family, but there is so much behind. I would say: enjoy, and forget that there’s been a previous season. I liked it. And I would watch it a few times! I tries to watch this but I couldn't stand how aggravating it was??? It wasn't funny and the characters felt so off. I'm just gonna pray the original cast gets back together in case they're gonna do a s3 or something. The new casts for Season 2 was sooo dissapointing. All their comedy acting seems forced. Unlike the casts from season 1 who were just naturaly funny even when they are not saying anything. Not to mention the original Aebong looks much cuter than this season 2 aebong.. i just miss the original cast as they were all perfect for the role... lee kwang soo really looks like a comic himself... whyyyy fix things thats not broken???!!! This reboot is Not Funny...previous cast was way better...mdoll sorry but obviously you're just one these girls who think the new jo suk is sooooo cute and all that...but we don't care bout that the first cast was so funny and so perfectly good I use to love this show so much but now there is really no point in watching this..it ain't funny at all!!!!!why did netflix Do that?????? Lame lame lame....the sound of your heart was soooooo funny all the characters were just excellents...The reboot is dumb and not funny at all...so disappointed!!!!Bring back the whole old crew!!!!!from the actors to the writers...I'm serious Netflix messed up soooo bad with this.....???????????? This was so spectacularly bad that I was really disappointed. Completely ruined the show for me. The new cast is no match to the old one. The first season was just too good. The same cast was the only way the show can be salvaged going forward. Had to re watch an older episode to remind me how funny this show can be. No one can replace Lee Kwang Soo. Those who said that they should have kept the cast on the previous season obviously have not seen the reboot. I was stunned how bad that show is. The first season was way funnier! They should have kept the original cast. whyyyy sorry but no thanks the guy that played the original one was wayyyy more better I felt like he fit the role more tbh why changed the cast?;( Sung Hoon is too handsome to be Jo Suk's character, still prefer Lee Kwangsoo over him:3 I can't wait to watch The Sound of Your Heart because of Sung Hoon. I so love his ways of justifying his character. Wowww... reunion after cool kiz on the block.. cant wait to watch this dramaa. Sung Hoon Oppa hwaiting ❤️ When is this airing? look forward to Sunghoon's new drama and his lovely performance. lee kwang soo still the best honestly when i first heard about this i wasn’t rlly sure if sung hoon could fit the role bc i’m so used to seeing him as a super attractive romantic male lead, but after seeing him in i live alone, i knew he could pull this off. not only is he a great actor, he has the ability to look shabby. i’m not saying he is shabby at all. i’m saying he can, if he wants to, look like a loser. there are some handsome actors that just can’t pull off a loserlike, shabby feel. for example, jung haein and cha taejoon. sung hoon is just as handsome as them, but they can’t pull off the same vibe. in conclusion, while i think lee kwangsoo would have been a better fit, we shouldn’t underestimate sung hoons ability at all. he seems perfectly capable of portraying this character. Why???? The previous character was perfect tbh.. whyyyy?!?!?!?!??!?! i love kwang soo and so min as jo suk and ae bong.... Season two is expected?? I didn't even have a clue Can't waittttt!! Why would you replace the whole cast... Disappointed:( Looking forward!!! lol.. its not that i didnt like Sung Hoon.. I love him after five enough! but mostly people watch this beacuse of Lee Kwangsoo. me and my family too. changing the lead actor make us (all KS and sound of.your heart fans) feels different and we wont bother watching itT.T we really miss LKS and the.whole cast! especially my mom. I saw season 1 (totally loved) and I’m looking forward to season 2! Sung Hoon can be really funny and has a good comical side. Watch Five is Enough! He was completely adorable so I’m sure he will prove himself once again to be up for this role! AJA AJA FIGHTING! Ugggghhhhh there’s no way it will be as good as lks and jsm. Even the supporting cast in season 1 was such a good fit. Probably won’t bother watching Aish!!!why!!why!!!jsm and lks was perfect for the character ... Ohh Im glad they replace the whole cast. Would be pissed to see LKS being left out. Still wont bother to watch this one. Jo Suk and Ae Bong is perfect for LKS and JSM So excited to see Sung Hoon again.... Aww i really like the original cast. Sad. It wont be the same without the original cast? I really like the casting ... I always watch SH and KYR in cool kiz on the block <3 <3 Yuri is my bias in SNSD. I'm looking forward to this drama coz i wondered how they're going to portray this, i mean this a comedy show but casting Sung Hoon and Yuri, it's like much more of a romantic drama than a comedy drama. It could be very different in this part coz the lead man is a good looking guy, hehe. Let's see if they're going to give us a different flavor in this drama. Exciting! Sound of Your Heart will not same without LKS and the other cast of season 1. This kind of drama need comical face:3 I dunno why they have to change the cast. I like Sung Hoon and he's so lovable in all his series. But I've watched SOYH with LKS. The cast are effin hilarious. There are no dull moments. They've delivered the series well. You should watch the S1 first. Omg!!! Yuri and Sunghoon, love them ❤ Sung Hoon and Yuri :)) Omo! I hope it was Han Hyo Jo for the lead female Jung so min pls!!! Love her I want yeonsang couple to be back...im hoping that SHS will be the female lead..they look great together yay kim ye won unni please I hope jung so min plays the female lead for the second one too. Sung hoon and Jung so min will look great together. Wow, I didn't watch version with Lee Kwangsoo, but I love Sunghoon and I'll watch with him anything. Whyyyy?????? Kwangsoo alrd suitable with the character ugh T^T wait.\",\n",

Very unique story and i wish that has a longer episodes. Its not a typical kdrama. It is Does ANYONE know what the name of the actor that plays the reaper who is \"God\\'s\" right hand? The one who pours the drinks and has high cheek bones??? HELP? I am sort of in between with this drama. There are so many dragging scenes but the story and concept is good. The development of the lead characters\\' feelings towards each other seems rushed. A lot of things related to the supporting characters were left unanswered. The whole drama seems too raw. Not too bad though. What a series.I love it.wel come back dear.You really did well At first I felt familiar with his face. Waiting for new season or for new drama,Kim Hyun Joong!Congratulations for special and unforgettable character Moon Joon -Woo and interesting story.Congratulations to all cast and producers for very beautiful drama. I missed him so much? after 4 years finally he is come to the screen? I hope I can see him more often?? KIM HYUN JOONG??❤️ I loved this drama my only K-drama of 2018. Absolutely loved the show.

Looking forward to watching more dramas where you are the lead male star Loved this series, so thrilled to see Kim Hyun-Joong back in action. nice seeing him back into drama. it was a nice story Well its a good drama but kind of felt like it was made in rush... I really enjoyed this drama. A little sad it had to end. I hate the ending!!!! It\\'s too soon to end this drama. Such a nice drama. Everytime I eagerly waited for next episode such an interesting drama. Gonna miss this drama. why did it end.. I want jun woo shi back.. jebaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaallllllllll More dramas to come for khj please Can\\'t wait for the next episode. Every episode is very interesting. I love KHJ ever since. Its a lovely drama... KHJ is really good looking there.. This is a very good drama with perfect lead actors. The story is very interesting and the OST is very good with a beautiful song of KHJ. I waited for a long time to see Kim Hyun Joong in a drama. It was really worth the wait but too short. Please don\\'t wait so long for your next drama. I\\'m glad you\\'re back. An Ji Hyun compliments you well on screen. Great job to both of you!! In Gyo Jin handled his supporting role superbly as always. It\\'s funny that the guy friend of sun-a like her but where is he when she needs help he always run away. it\\'s so good... love to watch show ... I\\'m so loving this drama --good work KHJ and the rest of the casts this drama is interesting and I\\'m loving it and will keep watching until the end.

Its good to see Kim Hyun Joong back on track again, keep it up and more power and God bless you always. WOW! Love seeing KHJ back on the screen. I support him all the way! @wieka i dont know the female lead\\'s acting style bc this is my first time watched her drama as main lead, maybe i didnt notice her character in other drama. So i\\'d choose no. Maybe bc of her smile, go eun and jihyun kinda have the similarity of smile Why do I feel like An Ji-Hyun is copying Kim Go-Eun? This drama has good quality. Me and my daughter watch it together. And we became KHJ \\'s new fans because of this drama. I Knew I would love this drama for Kim Hyun Joong but aside from his special ability to draw me in, I\\'m really enjoying the story. Feel frustrated for poor Suhn A and enchanted by our reluctant hero Joon Woo and nervous about his future encounter MyungWoon. I know by next week I\\'ll have no fingernails as I watch all the conflicts unfold. I\\'m happy to see Kim HyunJoong again in a drama, and this has been amazing since the first episode! I saw all the dramas where he worked, he\\'s a great actor, and a wonderful artist! I will continue to follow him, I only wish they were more episodes.

       "  'comments': 'I started to watch this drama and I got bored in the 2nd episode then I decided to stop watching it \\'cuz it was weird but I decided to give it a chance later and surprisingly I was hooked! This drama really touched me, in every episode was a lesson. Great storyline and strong acting. Kang Ji Hwan is so handsome men and fantastic actor?, Baek Jin Hee is just naturally cute, love her sincere beautiful smile. Hope one day these two great actors can meet in another project. this drama is really fun and contain many moral lesson focusing in office work @rrrrrrr.... episode 2 so so funny. I can\\'t stop laughing:) The idea of the story is rare. Interesting. And no wonder the actress got award. She deserve for it. Natural acting I am in ep 1. The story is so funny. Kang ji hwan acting is outstanding. Especially when he is drunk I can t stop watching again and over again:) <3 It\\'s funny and addictive . Continue watching without leaving then you can see how fun it is. It was sooo boring! The plot of last part in first episode has a big hole. I stop it on 2nd episode, enough Its funny how Mr Baek hair and suit was different when injung or they remember about the past (when Mr.Baek is still an evil boss), i mean his hair when he still a bad boss was smart during the first half of this drama  (i dont know how to explain since im not that good in english) , and he is wearing a suit! the best drama without kissing scene:v Best drama 2018 thanks Baek Jin Sang aka Kang Ji Hwan. Definetly very touching romance stories despite of they play it in comedic way. The problem is just not enough of BJS and LRD. Definetely one of best work of Kang Ji Hwan ever. Second is by Children of Lesser God. The Best Drama Of The Last Quarter Of The Year And Of Course One Of The Best Dramas Of Kang Ji Hwan. I laughed in every episode and leading roles have a beautiful chemistry. They have to end up together , ending of webtoon was so bad. Amazing and different story from the other korean dramas with time loop; perfect acting , funniest scenes and perfect emotional scenes, good story lines , beautiful romance scenes , one of the best chemistry and wonderfull final. I want second season <3 <3 <3 Weird caracter. Stupid story.boring OMG I can\\'t believe it ended!!!!!!! I am really touched by this drama that my tears just won\\'t stop when seeing how selfless and lovely BJS has become. It\\'s definitely not easy coz I understand the selfish thought that he had, yet he changed. So glad the ending changed for him too!!! Though it\\'s a bit vague for me I\\'m still so glad that I never give up watching this drama. It\\'s definitely the most exciting and realistic to the society one that I\\'ve seen. Kdrama always teach us lesson, moreover it\\'s so similar to our real life circumstances. It could be a harsh world, but don\\'t abandon humanity coz there is always love all around. So glad this is the last kdrama I watch before 2018 ends. Hope will see such great work again next year. ending sucks. changing the pair because they are both in time loop is idiotic. if so then everybody working together become husband and wife! Yessssssss yessssss ghamsahamnidaaaaaaa , beautiful ,wonderfull, amazing final , finally my heart will go onnnnnnnn , I am so happyyyyyyyy , you are so wonderfull , so sweet with together , I just need to second season now with more romance between BJS & LRD:D <3 I really like this series! And the way Baek Jin Sang growing each episode, i like him! Hopefully this is a happy ending for Baek Jin Sang and Lee Do Ra. I will never give up rooting for BJS. Seriously I am so impressed by how Korean drama always have me fall in love with the main lead guy, even a guy like BJS who has become so great now. I am so touched by him and the amazing chemistry of him and LRD so please don\\'t let the ending disappoint me, coz I really really love this drama? Well I just finished watching Mama Fairy and the Woodcutter, they exactly follow the webtoon including the ending, so I can say for this drama they gonna follow the flow of the webtoon as well, for those keep on rooting the main characters to end up together so dream on I really like this drama! The chemistry is great and the story line is unique. I hope this is a happy ending for Baek jin sang and Lee do ra. @GreenLova ahaha I\\'ve also noticed the subject of the coat many times:D I think this is not about the culture , they just want to save time while shooting series I guess:)) @Emma I agree with you about your feelings for ending now , something changes and as you say \\'\\' this drama was the best one I\\'ve watched this year, so I really hope the ending won\\'t disappoint me.\\'\\' <3 Good story line here. I like both the relationship with JH or JS. But the chemistry is happening only with JS so rooting for JS?. I have a feeling she will end up with Baek Jin-Sang despite the fact she ended with the other guy in the manga. Dramas change the story of the manga many times, plus, she has more chemistry with Baek Jin-Sang than with Joon Ho. They better change it, tbh, this drama was the best one I\\'ve watched this year, so I really hope the ending won\\'t disappoint me. I like Baek Jin Sang! he\\'s changing to be so much better day by day. Hopefully he will end up with Roo Da. I never read the webtoon before:) @rohit kattamuri: Relationships are almost same in the webtoon so I also don\\'t like the ending of webtoon. Writer was forced to explain why doing this. Normally there is no need to explain the reason if you have a good - satisfying story. She said it was a platonic love. I dont like such an ending but it seems it will be:( I want RD become lover with JS. I know everyone is wanting RD with JH. But honestly, RD has overcome many problems with JS and JS has day by day become a kind person. and with the time loop in drama. it has a connection with RD and JS. It is destiny. It is a rope that connected two people together. And one thing. I hope the ending will diffrent with webtoon. I want RD and JS become lovers so bad!!!!! @saesang...exactly..what is the point of adding love element to JS if story only needs him to become a good person and then failing his love. I donno how the webtoon was...the script between JS and RD, also between JH and RD. But here if director wants only platonic love and asked RD to act like that...then it is totally RD s fault for pinching our hearts. Common guys there is diff b/w how u behave with ur partner and u r platonic colleague. One shouldn\\'t cross that, so that audience don\\'t get confused. I dropped the drama already.. I think everyone is growing in the story. Their relationship and feeling have changed. I am really touched by the drama on how they focus on the characters\\' feeling, and every time I watch each episode makes me eager and anticipate to know more. Though I know JS was irritating at first, he\\'s changing, he just having his own principle that he thought was right. I cannot predict the ending as there are still 4 more eps to go, but now everything seems at the peak climate. Perhaps DR concern more abt JS coz of empathy or kindness or whatever it is, I still strongly believe the fate they hold together is a destiny. That\\'s why I really hope the drama would end differently from the webtoon, at least satisfying. @rohit kattamuri..yeah, but falling in love isn\\'t all about chemistry. It\\'s not real. RD trusted JH about their dark secret, even he felt it\\'s ridiculous, JH tried to understand. that\\'s a real thing between two lovers, you know. The problem is not that always main leads should get paired. But audience should atleast feel that there is love or chemistry between RD and JH. And not only that but main lead is getting head over heals for RD then how can one cannot ship main male lead with female main lead. If RD ends up with JH that would be absurd. I think we can get to know who s gonna end up with whom by next week. @rohit kattamuri I agree with you. Also \\'\\' This is not about the being different , it s just trying to different but being different is not always good, so ending of the webtoon is just like trying to different but declined \\'\\'. RD and JH don t have any chemistry and baek jin sang didn\\'t need to be in love. Why she makes a platonic love and throws the theme to the background. If theme is trying to make baek jin sang become a good man than there was no need to make him love Rd. But it seems it s will be like webtoon ending of the drama:( I don t like the ending at all . I hope the webtoon ending remains, am so sick of predictable dramas where the female lead falls in love with the main lead! It is possible to have a relationship (working/ friendship etc) with the opposite sex without automatically falling in love with them! Plus i dont think this is a romcom anyway. It would be refreshing to see the second male lead end up with the girl, hope the script writers are sheep who just follow the usual kdrama plot formula. @ekekaput Why does everyone want RD with JS. Despite he\\'s childishness, JH are able to take care RD from the beginning, could you imagine a childish person be able to do that? Look at JS, on his age, still a narcissistic. I love this drama so much. I like this kind of genre not so typical romantic korean drama haha. But please let mr baek with ms lee, not like in webtoon. Pleaseee pleaseee jaeballll? @Kpoppedbymymicrowave : Yes therefore I found ridiculous the end of webtoon. Because also in webtoon all events and scenes was with jin sang and I couldn\\'t feel love between RD AND JH. The ending was disappointing for me. Even the author had to make a statement. Lead role is jin sang and normally he have to catch the girl in a romantic comedy. No need to go in different directions in this style subject. This is not interesting, the opposite is ridiculous and absurd. I also like gong myung but there isn t chemistry between he and RD ( in webtoon and also in drama ). Maybe it is because you love gong myung so much. But if we look neutral, real love is going between Jin sang and RD. And I hope ending gets different from webtoon. Now jin sang and lee ro da are having a very nice love with the beautiful scenes. Hopefully gong myung takes the lead role in the next project. He should have a leading role so far. He deserves it. If y\\'all don\\'t want her with JH then drop the drama because if they go by the webtoon completely RD will end up with JH just like the webtoon Highly recommended drama! Great plot, great cast, my applause to all the people involved in this drama. Kang Ji Hwan, Baek Jin Hee you guys are real gems! Recommended drama, always waiting for the next episode!! Love it.. I love this drama so much. Cant wait for next eps. Hope the ending will be JS with DR. JH is too boring for me and i cant feel love between DR and JH. @sophieee I totally agree with you. Joon-Ho is childish and I want her with Mr. Baek Baek Jin Sang Lee Ru Da please writernim I wish it will be with Baek jin sang in the end <3 The series is getting even more beautiful, fighting Kang Ji Hwan <3 every episode is full of many life lessons. I need to watch one more time to understand better. Highly recommend especially who got fired meanly Baek Jin Hee\\'s acting is truly extraordinary..I love it Drama is very good Please make Lee Roo Da ended up with Baek Jin Sang. I will be verryyyyyy dissappointed is she ended up with Kang Joon Ho . Yeah, KJH is cute and very open about his feelings, but somehow, he seems immature, childish and boring. After ep 13 14, it is clear that there is gonna love from BJS and i think time loop will end only when they both love each other..that would be awesom..because his heart pained even when LRD is smiling with KJH in ep 14. Hope they create spark by end of ep 21 22.. At first I found this drama is quite interesting, but after watching the episodes, the drama is a boring one I think they will change the story plot of the kdrama from the webtoon version. I wanna see the outcomes of Baek Jin being with Roo Da;D Hilarious! I can\\'t help myself laughing all the time... Baek Jin Hee an Kang Ji Hwan are daebak!! Best comedy drama of 2018 love how this drama is turning out to be, but still hate kang ji hwan high pitched whiny tone:\") Still funny and amazing, I can\\'t wait the next episode, just enjoy this drama now, I even love the deep sadness in his eyes ( kang ji hwan ), fighting baek jin sang . Drama is more interesting than webtoon. I think the end will be different because it is progressing differently <3 @Shizuka so who\\'s gonna ended up with Lee Ro Da? Kang Joon Ho? A verry fresh and sweet drama Yes, this drama I can say, is the best of 2018. Overall 2017-2018 is the year of cliche and middle level dramas. But its about Koreans can do high level dramas and we all have big expectations, thats why we cant satisfy in 2018. But we should support and appreciate every work at least nothing is easy as it seems. Spoiler ahead this drama keep me hooked since the first episode and it getting more and more interesting!! love all the cast, the realistic & meaningful storyline. It deserve higher rating!! got hooked from the first episode, can\\'t stop laughing. very funny and brilliant drama. love it! So excited at first but after 3-4 ep found character of baek jinhee very very annoying and story a lot better than Jugglers. Started watching this drama with no expectations and got hooked. Kang Ji Hwan, not your exceptionally handsome lead but I was charmed by his brilliant acting. Baek Jin Hee, captivating since her \"My Daughter, Geum Sa-Wol\" days. Love the dynamics of both the actors. Waiting to see how the story unfolds... @saesang Jugglers (8.5/10) ended its boredom after 3rd or 4th episode. If you stayed up on it til that episode, you should have liked it better.:) I hope it\\'ll be different than the webtoon... I mean it was okay but I kinda disliked it for some reason. But the first episodes were quite good so I\\'ll stay watching This is the first time I get so hooked with a drama! I just watched the 1st ep and get hooked straight away by the story, but of course the acting of the actors are stunningly amazing! I really love this drama so far and I really hope it will have a different ending from the webtoon please~~~ @Aram I also watched \\'\\' Jugglers \\'\\' but could not finish. It s getting boring. I like her image here more and drama is funnier than Jugglers. Kang ji hwan is doing a great act and baek jin hee is good too. Yes this isn\\'t a very deep drama but current dramas are not so great. All of them are middle drama. Have a cliche romance therefore they attract more attention. Webtoon is a very simple but they\\'ve tried to add more things like a company criticism. Now very funny but will get more and more beautiful . Because Baek jin sang realized time loop. So more fun chapters coming. Just watching and having fun, no need to think much. I am liking this drama so far. The first six episodes are very very very funny and there are so much lessons in it. Haven\\'t watched Groundhog Day so the drama for me is quite fresh and new. \") So I just couldn\\'t understand the low ratings. What will happen next????? Im watching this drama because im waiting for park sol-mi\\'s character? Its nice drama though @Prime @saesang Actually I just took a look on ratings and I wasn\\'t surprised at all... As for me - I\\'m totally disappointed by this drama and today I decided to stop watching it. I absolutely loved \"Jugglers\" with Baek Jin-He (for me it\\'s the best \"middle drama\" this year). It\\'s not like I expected \"Jugglers 2\" or something like that, but from the cast and trailers I expected something way better than it is. The time-loop is actually a cliche already - after the \"Groundhog Day\" it\\'s hard to make it fresh again (it\\'s like a reheated dish, it doesn\\'t taste as a freshly-made). There\\'s something \"heavy\" in the script - instead of getting some relax I\\'m getting tired while I\\'m watching \"Feel Good To Die\", that\\'s why I\\'m saying \"goodbye\" to this series today. I\\'m sad to say this cause I was excited waiting for this title - I expected to have a good time with it... I am a major fan of romance drama but I thought i should try watching this drama because I have seen the webtoon everywhere. Not regretting at all about my decision!:D love this drama. Makes me laugh everytime. I can\\'t wait for more episodes. Acting of the male lead is really good and also love the female lead Prime , I agree with you , I don\\'t understand the reason for low ratings , It s a different and very funny drama . They love more worse dramas , interesting Why\\'s the rating going down? LOL I would love to have multiple 7th November so that I could celebrate my birthday everyday hahaha... Its similar to Groundhog Day an American movie. This drama is very different from jugglers.. Unique story. At first, I thought I\\'m watching a foreign movie(forgot the title) with time loop. After i\\'ve watched eps. 1&2, its just got me hooked right away. Kang ji-wan role here is a right fit for this drama, and baek jin-hee office worker role is the best for her. Kang ji hwan you are the best of the best , I love your acting, your voice, your gestures. This drama is very very different from jugglers. I like it more , so funny , it started so wonderfull and funny . I like baek jin hee too here because of her caracter and her acting. So I like they chemistry. I hope it will be different from webtoon and she falls in love with him too. I don\\'t want platonic love. ahahaha very funny drama Now that I\\'ve read the comments here that it\\'s different from Jugglers, I\\'ll just wait for some eps before i start binge watching. Its a good start, jinhee unnie is doing so good. This is going to be judgmental comment but i really hate that main guy\\'s voice its so pitchy and irritating to ears Fantastic drama! KJH is brilliant as the evil boss. Thank goodness for this drama cause k\\'drama land has been pretty dull lately... Fortunately very different with jugglers This drama is very different from \"jugglers\", very entertaining and has a unique story. main characters and storie are very good. salute to all the crew. can\\'t wait for the next episode...>.< I like Baek Jin-Hee, she is so cute in Jugglers. Definitely will watch this kdrama. Fighting Baek Jin-Hee.... why is gong myung the 2nd lead im sad,,, why second lead, I agree this sounds similar to her jugglers plot plus there is another actor who was in jugglers here as well Reading the plot, seems like Jugglers where she also stars in it. But I hope it\\'s different. Baek Jin Hee really do good job in office drama. I can\\'t wait for this drama.. let november be fast @lisa: The characters also have a big age difference in the web drama so that fits. I don t want baek jin hee but I don \\' t like the end of the webtoon too. I hope it will be different i love kang ji hwan, but the leads do not match at all, in height and especially age a 77er and 90er wth. pick an female closer to the male\\'s age and a female who can act. this girl ruined let\\'s eat 3, she can\\'t act, do accents well and can\\'t even eat prettily and that\\'s the easiest thing to do. wow so many webtoons and manga that I\\'m reading are being made into dramas. I can\\'t wait for this drama LOL such a coincidence that it was previously occupied by \"The ghost detective\" starring Daniel Choi, the actor who worked with Baek Jin Hee in \"Jugglers\" that made me big fan of them. i like kang jihwan but the lead girl, not a fan. Isnt this groundhog day-ish? Wow baek jinhee with office roles again? I love jugglers since she suit this type of role Come come come please ji hwan shiii with a rom com again <3 <3 <3 I don \\'t want Baek jin hee like a female lead but I hope they will have a good chemistry. is it just me or this feels like jugglers hahaha but still gonna watch it because its jinhee <333 Kang Ji Hwan is back in Romantic drama.. yay yay yay yay with Baek Jin Hee... So much looking forward to this drama .. waiting ❤❤??',\n",

       "  'comments': 'I would make a bad Kdrama writer. I could end this story now. Make Siu & mother relinquish any claim to the company in exchange for the liver. That would contradict Namjin\\'s giving nature, but that he was influenced by SJ\\'s love. just finished epi 84 and my hunch was correct the whole mystery was revealed in this epi tho i think its too early cuz there are 36 more epi to go unless there is another bigger mystery to solved which i dont have the slightest clue of what it is or unless the writer come back with a huge counter attach from the wicked wench or a some mystery person come back like mr ahn son to wreak havoc the drama wow the writer scored a huge one here he baffled all viewers and nobody have the slgihtest clue of whats going on everything we knew up to now was thrown out the window so its a new ball game from epi 83 one thing i new for sure was that siwu was the wicked evil wench ms choi son but thats not the case according to the dna test so who the hell is siwus mom also the dna test showed that siwus father is the late mr ahn son or at least they are blood related i think the key person to solve this is mr ahn son which supposedly died in the accident but he didnt die he survived but heavily injured in the head be became amnesiac and wandered around until he regained his memory and come back to explain the whole thing thats what i thought first but then i check the cast for mr ahn son and there is no picture there that means he will never show up in this drama the other clue is that namjina and siwu were born at the same date and same hospital by coincidence both babies came from the same father mr ahn son but from different moms one the real wife and the other fromthe wench ms choi but the bucket head idiot namjinas stepfather got confused and instead of abducting the real wife son he took ms choi son namjina cuz they were lying side by side and couldnt get rid of him so secretly he raised him am still very confused but the mysteries are developing real well so applause to the writer at 120 epi there are still 40 more epi to go so anything can happen I think NJ and SW are twins. I believe SH stole him from the hospital. She probably. had a connection there. @ann who is Nam Jin\\'s god mother? If you mean Soon Ja, that\\'ll mean this competition is pointless knowing that Shi Woo has no blood rights to claim heir to the business!! and if thats the case (which could be a possibility after watching episode 60) then im just want to see Ko Yeon and her stupid brother get busted for their pathetic scams, Soon Ja\\'s huband caught for extortion and blackmail and Mrs Choi\\'s face when exposed for murder kidnaping and fraud. Other than that i want to see Shi Woo transition from be selfish, self centered, arogant and cold hearted towards everyone to being respected, honest, loyal and loved by everyone around him. I actually kind of like how the secondary characters in this drama aren\\'t bad people (meaning Shi-Woo and Jin A), and (so far) are mostly honorable in their actions towards the protagonists, despite their rivalry. Siwo is the Nam jin\\'s stolen couple kid. Nam Jin\\'s god mom has lost her son by husband selling their son for money to Ms Choi . ok just watched ep. 53 and i dont know why im still watching this drama...the expected result of romance is now exposed and now were diving into the other sub-stories...and its those sub-stories that really pee me off, especially the return of Yang Soon-Ja so called husband (like he went to acting school in the 60\\'s) and the annoying Ko-Yeon Sil and her pathetic brother...the script writing is gone from cheesy to stupidity...im hang on by a thread here only to see how the competition ends and who gets the company and where each couple/s paths lead!!!! #12episodesoftourchertogo just finished epi 38 tho this is a cliche drama ive seen dozens of other dramas with the same plot the format is the same they only change the form but still is great and entertaing sometimes i watch 5 or 6 epi in a row cuz i cant stop i like chinae she is prettier than the lead female what i dont like is mr lee and the angel evil wench there story is too childish and stupid so i skip all of it but namjinas mom is really good she is always nagging but it is all true so she doesnt care who might be hurting from what she says the battle for grandpas clothing firm just started and i think namjina will lose the 1st contest but will win the next 2 so it will be a come from behind win and surely make grandpa very happy I can see how Mr. Lee tries his best to be on both sides, as they are family..hopefully he will always be fair till the end of this drama. Soon-Gyu, heartless man, should be in jail soon. I wonder what will the writer-nim do so he will get a fair punishment. just started this drama it was so good that i couldnt stop until epi 13 most of the dramas are lazy in the beginning introducing the storyline and the characters with bad comedy etc but this one was great from the initial whistle i hope it gets better and better and want to thank the writer for giving me so much fun and good time Just watched all 41 and saw previews of 42??. I just want to reach into the screen and slap Mr. Han silly. I can\\'t wait for the day his gold digging wife and her brother will send him into bankruptcy. His gullibility irks me. What\\'s wrong with all the male characters in this drama? All of them are in love with Jin-A? Well she is pretty but all the men feels is that she is a damsel in distress to be rescued! Change the character attitude of the side kick Mr. Lee. Such a traitor! Slsp the hell out of him. YES!!! a drama that has moral ethics behind the word \"romance\"...where 1st love doesn\\'t always conquers one heart and that the heart never tells a lie, it just makes mistakes!! ...hats off to a drama the literally everyone can relate to and not fantasise to mask reality!! GO TEAM 2!!!! lol up to episode 17 and i like this drama alot....im hoping Nam-Jin and Hyo-Rim end up together as they have a strong unique chemistry cause Choi and Jin-A suit each other if Choi straightens his act up (doubt it tho!!! lol) also Jin-A return home reacation to Nam-Jin in the early episodes of him not changing all these years (being still poor) pee\\'ed me off!!! I hate the character Lee Sang Hyun so much, he is homeless who has been saved by a good people then turning to be a shameless person: greedy, pervert,... I so far like this drama, glad to see Park Yoon-Jae again The story plot lines are great but the actress/actor is a little too stiff? If they improve their acting skills and make it look realistic then the movie would be better. Its awesome drama, i love it:) I can’t wait for the eps!! Love this drama Park Yoon-jae & Seo Hyo-rim as main leads...wow this drama is going to be very interesting, the plot sounds reallycalm and simple, but surely there is going to be some twist that changes Yoon-Jae character Nam-jin life around or make it become different. May have something to do with main female lead Hyo-rim character Seung-joo or even one of the supporting characters Choi Shi-woo or Jung Jin-A portrayed by Kang Tae-Sung & Jin Ye-Sol respectively. I will be watching tho!! ^^ This is awesome I can\\'t wait?? Interesting both the main leads',\n",

       "  'comments': 'i really like this movie. it\\'s fun. It\\'s pretty good drama...it\\'s fun (lots of comedy scenes) and it made me wondering who is the real husband...actually since the early episodes the writer already gave hints and i\\'m happy because my guessing was right...i was cried for jung yihyun or izy (last episodes)... What is the ost played at the end of ep 12 and 14, cannot find it in any websites, please help their are a lot of invition that r very good. wish for a drama that tells true in depth informtion and make it ascintific problem asking the oudeance to think of a how to refine the mechanism where the winers contrebution is writen on the end of each epesode. a master peace i wish to give it a reward for purety insonce i loved it wish 4 season 2 where all 4given and all can dwell bet the fairy and human world where the children that r out of good love would refine the world where they buld a very prograssive world all depending on equsysteem One thing I absolutely detest about Korean dramas is love triangles this show further made me hate these type cliched plots. It\\'s like writers can\\'t produce a single story without it and also worst afterlife concept you will ever see. LOLOLOL. All the cameos that voiced the CGI characters had me dead. Hahaha. Enjoyed watching this drama. Unique story for a fairy tale. Loved the bromance so much and the theme of friendship and redemption in the end. Although the CGIs could have been improved and the production could have added more budget to this drama and although the writing could have created this more fantastic and a real masterpiece if it had only focus on the story behind those amazing lessons that this drama offers that are so hard to find in other kdramas, it is still enjoyable to watch. Will watch this again, because I really had fun with how the webtoon writer played with its quirkiness plus again the deep messages that had warm my heart. What can I say about this drama? I\\'m not done watch this drama yet. But I hope professor jung end up with fairy. He makes me heartbroken he being punish for the rest of his life without knowing. I hope the ending is not the typical ending. I hope it has plot twist TT Why must jung yihyun being punish. Its not his fault. It his past life\\'s. Arghh I really don\\'t like this drama. I really like seo ji hoon. But this drama makes me agry. I want jung yihyun with fairy seon ok nam. When I watch these kinds of shows I wonder where the term entertainment has disappeared to and invoke a philosophical sense as to whether is there any purpose in watching cliched Korean dramas. Worst drama ever!! Im just regret to watch this.. really bad ending.. deserve for the low rating!! This drama was the one if the worst drama i have ever watched before. The whole story is ridiculous. It was okay in the first but when it goes to ep 10-16 boommm! I just didn’t believe that i wasted my precious time for watching this drama. The lead actress Chae won was so pretty but she wears only two clothes for whole movie. The plot twist was tooo absurd. And the ep 15 was so annoying. The only thing that made me happy was Mina& Ahn Youngmi. They were both so funny and so cute. Also they acted so well. I highly rec this drama ..I give it a 10/10 ..the couple I was rooting for won, and the plot was unique and interesting...really kept me on my toes and putting my detective skills to use trying to put together all the clues. I don\\'t agree about it being draggy...I thoroughly enjoyed it and it was a breath of fresh air to watching something different. The first episode is interesting, and then the pace is going reaaalllly slow after that. Too draggy. But it suddenly so rushed on ep 15 (which is near the ending). Dont spend even a single minute on this drama if you want to watch a drama. I havent read the webtoon , but blame the screenplay, script how it is put together. Not well handled. BUT, you want to wash your eyes.. oh yes! watch solid 16 hours of Seo ji hoon. He is too handsome to give up and damn well he can act! Kinda digging this 69% rating. This drama definitely deserves this bad of rating considering how bad it is. @ocean Park Shim Seon already use all of the 3 beans, first when he stuck on train tracks, second when he stuck on a boat, last he got reading skills. but lol that 3 beans doesnt teach him anything about life lessons  Haha i dont care i still love the drama. I so glad and greatly happy that they end up together. I ship them from the start.??? Some people left too harsh comments for the drama & the main couple. They have a beautiful chemistry even though the age gap is so far. The drama is warm & funny. I fell in love with this drama and i\\'m sad because the review & rating are bad. I read some of the comments before I watch mama fairy and the woodcutter. And I don\\'t agree with all the bad comments in here. I mean it was a happy ending what\\'s their to complain? The story was actually great it\\'s just that the graphics wasn\\'t that good. I enjoyed it. So for those who hesitate to watch this regarding on the bad comments please don\\'t hesitate to watch it coz the story was actually great. Among a catalog of Korean shows, I have watched this would be the one where I didn\\'t feel an iota of satisfaction as there isn\\'t a single moment where I genuinely laughed, felt sad or got angry. All that said, I briefly fell asleep a couple of times, because the drama is boldly bad, yes, but also boldly boring. \"I\\'ve seen worse...but I\\'ve seen a LOT better.\" I\\'ll stand by that it has decent acting and other things, but the entire drama left me meh. This maximum rating this show deserves is (6/10). With this drama, what happened to the standards of TVN? Considering this was pre-produced, I think this was executed badly. It is fun to read all the comments where people have different tastes. I\\'ve finished this drama few days ago and I must say I loved the ending and I love the overall messages of the drama. Should you watch it? It surely depends on your taste. But if you are looking for a drama that would warm your heart and heal your soul? The lightness, comedic style and very very heartwarming story behind the pasts and reincarnations of the lead characters as it reveals towards the end will surely warm your heart.:) I was hooked to this kdrama, im not a fan of noona relationship drama..but i watch it because of MCW, people have diff opinions but for me the main leads sparks a very cute and innocent chemistry..its a light drama, but the mother-children and father-children scenes makes me cry..they executed the feels so flawlessly..i cant believe why they have low ratings..but for me i super love it enough to finished it in 2 days... It\\'s true that everyone will be having different opinions about the acting, direction and the story of the show but for me, the only mystery here is how anyone let this atrocity out into the wild in the first place. Current user rating: 69 (920 votes) *baffled* Was it that bad?!? I don\\'t think so. I do not understand Korean dramas obsession with love triangles its like they cannot make a good TV show without it for me when I started Kdrama I didn\\'t care much of it but the same damn 2 guys one girl or 1 guy two girls cliched plot keep on popping up to the point its extremely annoying at times it gets me to thinking is there gender imbalance in S.Korea\\'s population and that\\'s the reason they keep on creating such type of content. Love this drama from start till end... It shows that if you have pure heart and keep loving somone... even if it’s one sided love... if you are destined to be together... that’s all matter... so never lose hope in love.? This drama was good at first but fell off towards the end the mystery (well written) but it felt like it got caught up in that aspect and tried to wrap up loose end correctly in a rushed manner the ending confused me. If I can compare this drama to another it would be “Bride Of A Water God” both are great but not as they could have been. The cast performances was great loved Moon Chae Won as usually. I hope Yoon Hyun-Min get the lead role that gets the girl his acting on point. Jeon Soo-Jin I’m loving her but her character in this was trash. I’ll be on the look out for few other cast members works. An appropriate title for this show would be \"Mama Fairy, Woodcutter and the Red Woman who destroyed a person\\'s life\". If you are into shows where you want a person\\'s hopes raised unessentially and watch him fall into a bottomless pit then this is for you. Aside from the acting part, yes you can call this show the Worst Drama of 2018 starting from support cast what is even point of them being in this show aside from just making filler scenes, then comes CGI I understand that this is just a TV show and the budget will be a constraint but still its not even remotely acceptable, then to the main story which is completely absurd and its just a miracle that web comic version got adapted into a TV series. The worst drama of 2018. Wow, this series is getting a lot of negative reviews I completed it just a while back I wouldn\\'t say its a good tv for its entirety at the same time its not absolute trash compared to other ones out there. After watching the show completely the philosophical side of me said this to me whose mistake is it that I watched this show completely towards the end that will make me regret it until who knows. Who was to blame for this situation is it me who decided to start the show after seeing stunning Moon Chae Won in the trailer, or is it the writer that is at fault for writing a poignant story or is it the producer who accepted to fund this show hoping that it will be made into a stunning hit or is it the K-Drama viewer base who are demanding such type of cliched content. P.S do not take it seriously its just my personal view. Mama Fairy and the Woodcutter is a type of show where it makes a Korean drama viewer say why and why in hell am I watching this is it perhaps I wanted to calm myself and enjoy 2 hours of this content every other week after a tiring working day or to make myself emotionally tortured with this content. I\\'m a little surprised at how harshly this series is being received. In some ways it is understandable because it is presented like it is a romantic comedy while in many ways it is not. I thought early on it was mostly a story about the two male leads and I would say that is mostly right. It is probably hard to stick a non-romantic story about two men into a genre. While I find some of the religious/philosophical reasoning underpinning this series problematic, I do recommend this series. It\\'s a pity there isn\\'t a better way to describe it. I am questioning why am i watching this drama till the end. I imagined the conflict is how professor jung finally remember fairy as his wife and how she find her fairy clothes but in dilemma of leaving the world since she finds her husband. But the story turned out to be soooo weird in the last episodes, with unnecessary plotwist? my bad tho, i should have researched the webtoon story first... I agree with @knight1 up to some extent. However, the main male lead does have some internal problems that he needs help with. (I skipped through the drama for the most part, so I may have missed some details) However, for the first 12 episodes or so, the main focus was on the relationship between him and ON. (SPOILERS) Him being the villain came out of nowhere in the few final episodes and his problems that weren’t explored in enough depth were resolved just as quickly. It would have been better to establish him as a villain early on so he could get proper character development. And if the drama had not focused on him so much as a romantic lead, but a protagonist who has their own character arc, it wouldn’t have been this disappointing. This is a drama where the main lead is living if not perfect a steady life then comes into picture the female lead the second male lead and all the bullshit fairy characters just to RUIN his life. To hell with this drama and ending. This whole movie sucks! Very confuse and misleading.. Why everyone is hating on kim geum?? Simple..just because kim geum is lame I hate this drama. Who is the hero anyway. Who is the main role. I want ok nam with ji hyun. Although it is different from other drama still this drama make me dissapointed and upset. Why everyone is hating on KG? He\\'s nice & sweet. He sincerely loves ON. Why is everything seems to be not fair for PJ? I dont care if he wont end up with ON. Both KG and ON are boring anyway. But why making PJ go through all the hardship....... I agree with several opinions. I\\'m from the PJ team. Before seeing ep 14, my theory was that one way for the red fairy to have her revenge (for the betrayal) is to make her believe that KG is her husband, interfering in the memories of each one. At first I thought that Professor Jung was the reincarnation of the red fairy, but no, he has been possessing it so that he could also interfere in another way. I do not know how far his power comes, but he is using it. It is causing KG to have a sweet dream and then wake him up in reality and he will have been tricked ... @sarah...lol come to think of it PJ recognised Jeom Soon (cat/tiger) straight off the bat, yet did know anything abt the egg...and the egg only reacts to KG!!!...lol I would like to think the woodcutter is the prof and geum is really dubhe...prof is just human... in the fairy world, geum is fairy ok nam\\'s first love...but izy manipulated the human world so that fairy ok nam marries the woodcutter...now in the present world, izy makes the prof think he is izy...but as the monk said, he is not one of them ( he is human, not a fairy)...now, fairy ok nam has to choose between her first love, geum and the prof, her woodcutter husband from 600+ years ago...personally, I\\'d like her to choose the prof... he actually has a good heart, he provided accomodation to Geum, his mom and the fairy trio... it\\'s just that his pitiful pass kinda screwed him...geum was a fairy anyway, and has got lots of charms, he can always find another pretty gal to fall in love with... @Umbareen agree with you.. I get feeling from the start kim geum is more important role than prof jung i also don\\'t get why he is put as first male lead..prof jung doesn\\'t have electric chemistry with oknam... Team oknam kim geum .. This is my presumption ms. Fairy husband was the face and body of prof.jung but soul of dubhe/bausae and the deer is fairy yiji who also like ms. Fairy ok nam that\\'s why they have both memories @anne...why would banned mizar steal Ok-Nams wings and set up Dubhe (KG) at the fairy river? shes trying to split them apart!! (or make KG suffer)...PJ is the original woodcutter, KG is Oh-Nams first love!!! i still dont think KG is the original husband...PJ is!!! mizar using PJ reincarnation body as a vessel to seek her revenge on KG...the monk said \"you are you, your not one of them\" \"dont let them manipulate you\" hes just a poor orphan used as a sacrifice to the gods/fairys for good fortune and mizar didnt like it!! Get the girl or not wont change the fact that prof jung is the lead since his character is the key of the whole story. The drama is about his past lifes, his point of view, karma, etc. Its true that there is kinda unusual when the male lead doesnt get the FL but it happens sometimes. This serial has left me in curiosity that who is the real woodcutter I am pretty much excited to see the end i really like ok nam and Kim geum together its damn confusing that who is the real woodcutter in each episode it\\'s becoming more confusing so I am really waiting for an good end I dont understand why the story seemed to be confusing to some ppl. Me, after i re-watched the show i found it more simple . Kim geum is potrayed as the lead since episode 1, Yoon hyun min was side lined like a second lead, therefore i failed to understand why he was potrayed as lead ( i cant say what the story will turn out as its still 2 episodes left). Bottomline Fairy loves Geum ( bause/ Dubhe) so its only him she will end up with. And people expecting that Bause will be Professor are hoping in vain because there\\'s enough shown scences where (Dubhe or KG) has memories of the woodcutter. Even children aknowledge him as father. I pity Professor Jung though , but i guess he will be ok with Ham sook. @Kim same here. I really wanted Prof Jung to end up with Ok nam. the episode 14 is trying to tell us that Geum is his husband and first love. However we still have 2 more episodes. We still dont know why Bausae left the fairy realm. i vote for Prof Jung...he\\'s soo pitiful. Geum has already had his loving mother by his side. @wwe her husband and her true love is KG so,... At the end of episode 13, prof jung told fairy ok nam that she must know the truth. I can’t wait to know what truth is that. Im sure it has to do with Ok Nam’s first love. I am still confused.. Prof jung is reincarnation of the fairy yiji or her first love and kim geum likely her husband.. I don\\'t know anymore wkwk Prof jung\\'s character is just sooo pitiful. I dont even care about the fairy anymore. I just want him to get his happines in this life after being unlucky, unloved, and tortured in his previous lifes. His broken state really broke my heart. I see you in a new light, actor Yoon Hyun Min. Kims right....script writers put a twist to this fable/webtoon...likely character for OH to viewers would be hands down KG and not PJ (episode 13) but what if the past (flash backs) was re-written through OH eyes/memories for us to see. Flashback starts off with PJ as the woodcutter and as the drama progresses OH starts to miss/have feelings for KG and flashbacks become KG woodcutter. What if the one you once loved was NOT the one you married? And while being married with the one you mistook as your first love, you truly feel in love with him? This is the story of the fairy and the woodcutter after all. If i am the writer, I will write it this way and not follow the webtoon. Prof Jung is definitely the first male lead here. I’m just disappointed why they should follow the webtoon’s story. Very predictable. Still hoping prof Jung and Ok Nam will end up together though. Who knows? Agree with key. At their worst, the woodcutter is the devil incarnate and the fairy a moron in the legends. Lmao why people keep saying prof jung is a jerk though? He never once hurt oknam (idk with his past life but in this life he didnt do anything that deserve to be labeled as a jerk). And about geum, do people really watch this drama? There is a part when he said to geum that he didnt want to pick a fight with him and vice versa, they can compete fairly to get her. So whats the problem?? Everyone thinking the lead actor changed because Kim Geum is the husband is completely wrong, imo. The whole drama so fair has been around Professor Jung\\'s feelings, his past life and karmas. Professor Jung is still a lead, even tho he won\\'t \"get the girl\" or whatever cliche thing everyone always use in kdramas to consider an character lead worthy. Lol I don\\'t understand how people prefer Prof Jung. I know his character is damn funny and interesting but KG is pure kind. Im rooting for KG and MF  tbh, if ever Ms. Fairy end up with Prof Jung, I will stop watching this drama. Hate me or not but I still prefer Geum than Prof Jung. Ms Fairy deserve better and I\\'m sick of male lead being jerk. We need Geum in our life, who being sincere and kind person. I didn\\'t understand anything that wwe wrote. I think PJ belongs with his lady colleague that loves him so much and has for 10 years.. I\\'m team KG. If KG doesn\\'t end up as her husband I will be disappointed. Currently, this is one of my favourite new drama and the plot is quite refreshing. I hope Ms. Fairy will end up with Kim Geum. I just love his caring, lovely personality and they really look cute together despite their age gap. Can\\'t wait to see the ending! Im not hating but i think KG is such a boring guy. Too pure, too kind, not interesting at all. But PJ doesnt have a great character as well, even tho i always think that YHM is hot hehe.. The way the characters written is a mess, i got bored but i need to continue to find out who is who.. It seems like Hyun Nim has lots of supporters but I\\'m still rooting for Kim Geum as the woodcutter. KG and ON looks cute together and it really broke my heart at the ending scene of ep.11 but seeing ON having feelings for KG at ep.12 gave me high hopes. Also, Jeomsoon is really close with KG and Jeomdol calls KG his father. Four more episodes to go and I\\'m hoping that I won\\'t get disappointed with the ending. Well, I started watching this drama mainly for Moon Chae Won...the plot caught my eye at first but it got fairly boring and messy midway (I\\'m trying my best to catching up at the moment >_<) Who is PJ? and KM? Someone tell me please? It has a nice story but it is terribly portrayed!!!! Can\\'t wait for the end someone please tell me, who is PJ and who is KM? @Miamiao They don\\'t turn KM into main lead because he is the husband in the webtoon. The story is like that. Prof Jung is still the main lead. Don\\'t worry Look a like the writer want to turn KM into main lead. I\\'ll be rally piss off if KM is the husband. Please writer, no more cheese in trap incident will ya!!! PJ team here!! ok episode 12 gave us alot more sense now...PJ IS the woodcutter!!! (that saved the deer and fell in love with OH bearing 2 children) and KG is the woodcutter that took over his PJ\\'s death off the cliff, to be with OH and retrieve the wings back from the deer. The fire fairy (lady in red dress) is seeking revenge to KG love for OH and not for her in fairy realm thus getting blamed/banned for OH not returning. Im so frustated with this drama. is this really adopted from webtoon,is there anybody who can give me spoiler how the ending arrrghhhh still few ep to the end ...there must be twisted in the character Everything is good at first. They have Moon Chae Won and Yoon Hyun Min as leads so this story got me though. But it becomes really awful halfway. wow...episode 11 got me angry!!! this drama portrays no loyalty between friends and yet the writer then makes KG look like an angel and PJ look so selfish and it doesnt help when OH keeps pulling at both mens hearts with her \"hi-almighty cryptic, romantic, ancient philosophical lines she comes up with!!!...and of course the post scene proves that the deer is the main key to this annoying triangle!!! i will be so frustrated if KG is her husband thoo!!! I regretes to watch this triangle love story, bcs im so biased to jujg, kinda want him to be the woodcutter, i hope more plot twist here My kind of drama!!! Its fairy tale, its fantasy, its puzzling, its mystery, its suspense, its comical, its sweet and romantic but not like soap opera.. The plot is so slow but i still watching it? Team Prof. Jung! I like their chemistry and he is so cute! Sorry to say but for me if Ms. Fairy end up with Geum the ending will be kinda boring. I would love to see character development on Prof. Jung since Geum has been nice and sweet since the start of the drama. I hate the triangle love it give me so damn headache...and it pissed me off bcs i dont understand well the storyline....>~< i was very confused....wether it jang or geum......but sometimes im kinda hate geum for being so nice.....i would dare say that geum will be along with her dauhter......i hoped that this drama will end well n stop the triangle conflict asap....bcs i hate it so much of course PJ modern times is an ass (mortals usually are!!) KG is a fairy, course hes kind, humble and loving!!! I don\\'t get how people ship PJ when he is a total asshole and selfish freak. While KG is the one who seriously, honestly and sincerely loves the fairy ON, PJ thinks only about himself. Before he is annoyed of ON and when he learned that KG loves ON he decided to love her as well and even has the guts to tell KG to forget his feelings for ON. Seriously what a selfish ass............. I like Kim Geum. He so kind and soft. Seonnyeonnim please don’t leave him TT I think kim geum is mama fairy son.thats why he feels close to her SPOILER Kim geun: what if I didn’t let her go?? ok episode 9 dropped and mama fairy is getting my theories all criss crosssed and i can ramble on about the deer showing up and the fire fairys spirit showing up...but out side this twisted confusing plot of a drama...the korean most told folklore states \"a fairy loses her wings, falls in love with a mortal woodcutter, weds him and lives happily with his family\"...so whos the only mortal in this drama? Jang!!! Team Kim Geum. kim geum?? yeah he is cute and all, but after episode 8, his greed for mama is starting to show the true colors of a jealous/evil fairy while jang confessed his true feelings to mama and kim openly!!! so who do you want to vote for now??!?!?!?!? JANG ALL THE WAY!!!! Please let her end with kim geum!!!! He’s such a cutie @Clarice I agree with you, I thought there might be a twist like happen in Reply 1988 where the female lead ends with the 2nd male lead, the woodcutter is the lead actor (you can see who is the lead actor above - hint: he\\'s the one beside the main actress) and the young boring guy is the fairy who she used to love. She ends up with the woodcutter because even though he\\'s not her first love he\\'s her true love. sorry if I spoiled the ending. so who is literally the male lead here? can\\'t even justify, I think that these three fairy stories are relationship, the story starts from the friendship between the three fairies in heaven, which turns into a love triangle between them, one day the fire fairy is revealed to the earth because it doesn\\'t want to be a fairy and her love has been betrayed by the wind fairy because wind fairy prefer \"ok nam\" water fairy. And the wind fairy was punished by a white-haired old man for making the two fairies broken hearted and sentenced to be sent to earth. I like the chemistry between the Fairy and Prof Jung, there\\'s a lot of cute and funny moments with this two and it makes me smile, however, I do prefer Ms. Fairy to end up with the cutie Mr. Kim, they are so warm and innocently the sweetest interaction when they are together. SPOILER!!! I would want kim Geum to be the reincarnation of the woodcutter just finished episode 8 and this drama got me confused....but heres what i gathered....wind fair (kim) betrayed the fire fairy (shrink/modern day) in the fairy realm for his love for mama fairy, thus getting the fire fairy banned from the realm....she seeks revenge by stealing mama fairys wings, disguised as a deer only to keep mama fairy from returning back to the wind fairy in the realm...thus setting up jang to fall in love on earth and to keep mama interested in jang is when the deer mention to say the name \"dubhae\"...the egg (brother) can only be activated by mama fairys husband OR A MORTAL!! thats how kim did what he did to the egg...as kim can talk to animals!! jang is no god/fairy, just a normal human reincarnated to mordern day....as for the lotus flower (supposably only blooms to mamas husband in the full moonlight) in kims room blooming its only because jang was there aswell in the room (not just kim) as the flower nodded \"no\" when asked by kim if \"your alright?\"...jangs memory as the husband/wood cutter is suppressed by the traumatic upbringing...as for the kims dreams of mama fairy is probably the love he lost when she didnt return from the lake ...as i think he watch on from a distant (too late) as mama/jang and 2 kids were to strong to break apart their bond as a family (thats how he knows abt the satchel hang on the tree and the deer warning that the wind fairy might be disgusing himself as the husband!!)...well thats my theory!!! ty Somehow rooting for KimGeum with the Mama Fairy... @Umbareen I actually think Kim Geum is boring as hell. According to the plot as it goes i guess one can\\'t help but fall for Kim Geum. I really dont get how people find reasons (like Seo Ji hoon is too young or Professor Jung is too hot ) how does this justify that Professor should be the husband. Each actor is doing great job. The show was confusing at the start but the story hooked me so did the chemistry between the fairy and kim Geum. I think the only downside of the show is the unnecessary characters and scenes. Some scenes seemed very childish..it could have been shot better than they are already. Live this fantasy and romantic kind of drama... Seems we live in the fairy tale... Keep it up and maintain the good work! Anyway can\\'t wait to watch the next episodes... I really2 hope that yihyun is the fairy\\'s real husband @Lia but one of the fairy friend was a female so I think its the psychologist who is friends with professor is the second fairy friend who disappeared because she is starting to see the fairy as young I think Kim Geum is the real husband, because he can talk to animals and really cares about fairy mothers and jeom som. the second child of a woodcutter also responds to the touch of Kim Geum. then I think the professor is a fairy friend, reincarnating into a deer then talking to Kim Geum, that\\'s why he also remembers the meeting of the Kim Geum with fairies. because at that time he was also in river bran. then the unsolved question is the reason for the loss of the two fairy friends Can anyone explain to me when thus other people see the young ok nam?at first they see the old ok nam. After they look at her again she change to young ok nam. Cant seem to identify what the ordinary people do to let them see the fairy ok nam? Okay, this is what i can say about this drama so far.. I don\\'t know why but i guess i expect too much from this drama.. This is seriously kinda boring, so many unnecessary scenes, unnecessary character.. Mostly, what bothers me is the fact that the fairy in old lady shape, should they be like always young? And when the male lead doesn\\'t impress me, and the second male lead story way more interesting.. This could be better.. Poor plot poorly written Could Yihyun be that deer and Kim Geum is actually her husband? Her husband did have an ability to talk to animals. But then why did YiHyun apologize to Jeom Soon? I don\\'t know anymore. They have too many loose ends that I\\'m wondering how they are gonna piece everything together. This drama is too boring. Not sure why I have watched till 6th episode. i kinda feel that Yi hyun is the reincarnation of her fairy friend (the lady fairy) and without a doubt Kim Geum is the reincarnation of the fairy she had a crush on Dubhe.. they both disappeared in the fairy realm.. Fairy Ok nam thought the Woodcutter is the dubhe.. Their first child came from fairy suk nam and kim in the fairy world, while their second child came from jung a woodcutter, seeing the episode where jung apologized to the second child because he died when his son grew up without a father I like ki geum. But i want ok nam find that she\\'s fallin in love with someone new. She doesn\\'t even feel anything with her reincarnated husband! Pleaseeee?? kim geum is a fairy, the fact he can talking with animals. mama fairy realize that, and why the egg respons when kim geum touch it is because he is a fairy. like jeom soon said, her brother only respons to family or fairy/witch. and yes, because kim geum is a fairy. I don\\'t why but I really want Jeomsoon end up with Kim Geum ^o^ They really look cute together AAAAA. Also, if that doesnt happen, in other case, hopefully Seo Jihoon will be the lead and end up happily with the Fairy <3 this drama is good but annoying in the way that mama fairy really was in love with Kim Geum due to the fact that Jung used a name related to her past crush with Kim (before her 1st encounter at the waterfall with Jung)....but Jung is the reincarnation of her husband and theres no stopping her love for her husband no MATTER her previous love to anyone else past or present...yet there seems to be some sort of past memory clash between the present brothers (im up to Episode 6 by the way) and Jungs memorys are somehow crossing over to Kims as he starts to remember things that (i think) belongs to Jung only...maybe some sort of trauma up bring in their childhood brought about this memory swapping? Im so confused. I want mama fairy and professor jung will end up together.they look cute together I failed to recognized the old lady who played Ok-Nam is actress Ko Du Shim. I remember she was on the show \"Master In The House\" with Lee Seung-Gi and the scene where they are at dance club cracked me. lol Kim Geum is the reincarnation of her husband, and Yihyun is the rencarnation of his best friend @Caty if that\\'s the case, which means her son was born as a human and died, her daughter Jeom Soon was born as a half immortal tiger? and what about the big egg in her room?? but literally seems to be Yi Hyun is the male lead, or probably her true love is the woodcutter or maybe she don\\'t have any feeling for her incarnated husband, just to find her fairy clothes? @Caty I think that she mistaked her fairy husband with the woodcutter, but they are not the same. Yi hyun is the reincarnation of the woodcutter and kim geum is the reincarnation of her fairy husband. (also, for those who don\\'t know the fairy and the woodcuter is a well known fairy tale in korea). i find it interesting for the 1st and 2nd eps...but 3rd and 4th ....boring came to me ...i felt a sleep many times...so many unnecessary scenes maybe....hope to be more interesting in the coming eps... Sarah I have been thinking the same.. I remember there is two child.. Maybe yi hyun is reincarnation of her son and Kim geum is the husband Am I the only one thinking that Kim Geum is her incarnated husband?? I have to say thank you Kang So Ra for dropping this drama. I don\\'t know why, but I always drop her drama after watching few episodes. Omg seo ji hoon!!!! I really hope he will end up with moon chae won?? can the grandmother\\'s part be reduced or eliminated??, seriously, watch the drama becomes boring because eonni mon chae woon rarely appears, and the three-part part is useless Wow..... The synopsis looks interesting...gotta watch it asap? Already watched episode 4 and it\\'s still boring! Looks like I\\'m going to drop this drama soon whos name the girl with glasses? she beautiful I\\'m really loving this drama so far!! I love Moon Chae Won and while she\\'s a wonderful actress I don\\'t think she\\'s right for the role. I can think of several others that are better fit albeit not of the same caliber acting-wise as Moon Chae Won or Kang So Ra who was the first pick for the role of Sun Ok Nam. I would love to see Jeon Soo Jin as a lead. I love all characters in this drama but will highly await Soo Jin starring role. I really like this drama ... can\\'t wait for next episodes??❤ Love the start of it , can\\'t wait for more episodes , hope the plots progresses well, fighting! Love all the casts. Funny and stress relieving drama.? This drama is hilariously fun to watch. It gives plenty of good vibes. Will recommend to those who want to escape from all lifes\\' drama and be refresh with the actors funny banters and acts. Must watch??? Why there\\'s no one supporting Seo Ji-hoon? He is also a good actor Totally in love with this drama... Moon chae won is lookung damn pretty the first episode rating gets 5,6%;) good job all team Mama Fairy and the Woodcutter!!!! fighting ~^^ really like this drama, so funny .. @bbongs the webcomic made this well known fairy tale more palatable to modern sensibilities (ie. people who are easily offended). @dmhg lol not really. In the webtoon, which this drama is adaptated of, she stays on Earth because the Woodcutter is the reincarnation of her fairy love who was expelled from heaven. So no, she doesn\\'t marry to him unwilling. Jeon Soo-Jin, yes, I really like her acting. The trailer’s so good for including 2 time periods!!! I hope the plot gives it justice. Absolutely cannot wait for this!!! the circumstances of this marriage are so very messed up LOL the dude stole her clothes, forcing her to marry him yikes This gonna be lit? Can’t wait. Ilove seo ji hoon? Can\\'t wait to watch it I’m so excited, this drama looks so fun! Especially now that its Moon Chae Won! Ahh she’s so natural beauty, like dang girrrrrlll I think it\\'s like in Hauru no ugoku shiro, the lady is very old and only these two guys can see her young form , that\\'s why she think that one of them is the reincarnation of her lover. Teasers looks fun and cute!! @wow Wow, both the main characters are my favorite November come palli-palli <3!! ‘Wow’ what you’ve said resonated with mine too...yeah....same here hahaha....i’d have the same answer too. Hahaha...’after waiting for some 600 years for one crap person to reincarnate...indeed i’ll beat the crap out of him for the next 200 lives’ hahaha. Peace..what a story... moon che won fighting! Can\\'t wait!! Chaewon unnie fighting <3 i liked KANG SORA but im hapoy that MOON CHAE WON will be portraying the lead role.... Since i missed her in the small scren The webtoon definitely has a beautiful story, finished reading a couple days ago. I like Moon Chae-Won but I thing moon ka Young could’ve been a really good lead but I’m sure mcw would be able to portray this character well Tbh, i want kang sora to be a female lead in here but i think its because of her busy schedule. But Moon chae won is good too, can\\'t wait for this drma?? Sounds like the manga/anime, \"Ayashi no Ceres\" Omggg..therre is another drama with same plot..i think its a remake of that...its 2012 \"i need a fairy\" with shim hye jin as the fairy mother and hwang woo seul hye as the fairy....cant wait for this... Can\\'t wait! Hurry up plz plz plz! @wow The beginning circumstances reek of deceit and enslavement. You steal a fairy\\'s clothes forcing her to be bound to earth. Then you marry her and have children. She is stuck on earth for 600 years because of your lust and now after reincarnate she\\'s still trying to find her clothes. If I waited 600 years for you to reincarnate, I\\'d beat the crap out of you for your next 200 lives!!! I\\'ll watch this because Kang Mina (gugudan) is here. Kang Mina hwaiting! How come Seo Ji Hoon looks so damn fine next to Moon Chae Won?? I like it! Can\\'t wait to watch this drama. I missed Moon Chae Won so much! ❤️ The perfect cast!!! i cant, plus seo ji hoon oh God. Im dying >< Can\\'t wait to watch Moon Chae Won. She\\'s such a great actress A new Kang Mina (gugudan) project, can\\'t wait @Ifa omg the story is also the same as the malay version too!:D Can\\'t wait for the drama and wow the synopsis reminds me of a malay fairytale story.. I forgot the name of the story tho I\\'m really excited to see how they are going to adapt this drama. I see they already made some changes from the webcomic, what more will they change? IF they follow the original story of webtoon her husband is Kim Geum (Seo ji hoon ) so finally a drama where Second lead Win the end game. Love you Seo ji hoon. I\\'m so excited for Moon Chae Won and Yoon Hyun Min!!! And actually this drama has the same story like Indonesian fairytale. A man stole the fairy clothes while the fairy took a bath. And they\\'re getting married, have a kid. But finally, the fairy knows that her husband is the one who stole her fairy clothes. And she decided to leave her family, she went back to her world. waaaaah!!! unnie Chae Won so excited for your new dramaaa! waiting for this drama. hope successssssss! so excited. i hope they can make fantasy as possible. like in Cdrama:) @Saphire Yes, in every reincarnation her husband had a different face. So his husband will appear with different face after reincarnated? OMG Finally Moon Chae Won! love both actor and actress so much! Glad to have them back? @Dwi I am Indonesian but this kind of folktale has many different versions. Not only in many countries, even in Indonesia they have many versions. Your version is \"Jaka Tarub\" but in my place in Indonesia, we have similar story as well but not \"Jaka Tarub\". If even in Indonesia, we have many different but similar versions, it\\'s more than possible they have different versions in different countries. Research first before demanding permission. You brought the name of Indonesia after all. @dwi for you information Korea also have the folktale story about what you mention not only your country. To everyone seeing similarities between the Indonesian folktale and the webtoon/drama plot is because Korea has the same exact folktale as well, and many others asian country too. In Korea is called \"The Fairy and The Woodcutter\". You can google it. People please do your research before saying that the story is ONLY based on your folktale. The legend of heavenly maiden (or swan maiden in west) is almost found in every country with different setting. There are woodcutter in Korea, herd boy in China, fisherman in Japan, Jaka Tarub in Indonesia (sorry, I don\\'t know his profession). Hey, this is Indonesian\\'s famous folktale called \"Jaka Tarub\". Yosh! Chae Won unnie!!! FIGHTING For those one who said it is similar to the folktale Jaka Tarub OMG Moon Chae Won for female lead OMG! I cant wait for this! Daebak! YES!!!!! MCW!!!! oh it\\'s like the japanese manga/anime Ceres, Celestial Legend (Ayashi no Seresu) I agree with the other opinion, which says the drama is similar to the folklore from Indonesia \"Jaka Tarub\". Perhaps the author was inspired by the story.\").. Wow!! Yay! Moon chae-won and Hyun Min.. this is gonna be ultimate drama.. looking forward to this beaitiful drama ❤ The basic plot is very similiar to indonesia\\'s folktale \"Jaka Tarub\". I wonder of the writer inspired by this story or not. Because if she is, then she should have mentioned it. yesss moon chae won The plot was originally, smilar to Indonesian folktale \"Joko Tarup\" & \"Oheo\" lee ha na should play this role it is really good I really want to see Song Ji Hyo play the female lead, this actress is soo gorgeous and had dollike delicate visuals, and she always has amazing chemistry with her partners Just an intersting plot. Waiting forward to this drama The synopsis looks like promising ... I\\'m so curious to watch this drama .. Hoping all the crew can do their best.. All the best for you!! Kang sora is a great actress and her face is really resemble to that female character on this webtoon. ( Sorry for my bad eng) she is really has a pure heart. Fighting Kang sora-ya!!! Just watch this drama and you will love her, i\\'m sure about it;)) Ahh~ South Korea also has that kid of folk tales... In my country, We also has this kind of folk tale. about angels going down to the earth with his sister and can not go back to the heaven because someone took her fairy clothes... Then you don\\'t have to watch it Quite an intersting plot. Waiting forward to this drama Aw I want Park So Dam to be the female lead:( Love the premise. But Kang Sora? Not a big fan of hers at all. YASSSSS my kind of drama. this myth (woodcutter & fairy wive) have various version...including my country... i bet this myth are very popular around ASIA.. Too good and great pair to cast! Drama news keeps getting better and better. Can\\'t wait to see who they cast as second leads and hopefully they won\\'t distract from our main characters so much we suffer from 2nd lead syndrome! This has to be a rom com with a lot of hugs and kisses and not star gazing at each other for eternity Mr/Ms PD/Writer pretty please ❤️ This is sounds like Jaka Tarub I hope Yoon Hyun Min takes the lead or even second lead that\\'s fine by me i really hope jung suk the main lead i want them in drama since doctor stranger i bookmark this drama sounds good:) Sounds very much like drama \"Sent from Heaven/I Need a Fairy\\'\\' The modern Jaka Tarub',\n",

       "  'comments': 'I watched this drama for season 4 (because of lee donghae oppa) and i was like curious for season 5...i just watched 4 episodes and so far it was \"so so\" for me...i loved the story idea (specially codas) but the main characters were judging the suspects too soon before they explained the reason why they have to go through that way in their lives...and it made the message a little bit disappointed (for me)...i wish it\\'ll get better for next episodes... @Ve watch the drama, it\\'s good....I won\\'t spoil it here... hello, can someone explain me what connection hyun sang pil with nfs people? and what problem between mrs jo young sin and mr kwak had before? This drama is absolutely good!!! The entire 5 seasons are wonderful and very interesting.... I really love this drama especially han jin woo....he is so cute!!!! His height is extra small for a korean actor and thats what i love about him!!! His relationship with detective kang are so adorable!!! Including dr.jo...his attitude may seem rude but thats what make all people around him feel comfortable and having fun!!! Seriously if you guys haven\\'t watch it yet you must watch it!!! Still sad bcz season 5 had finished....I really hope they will be season 6 I love season 1-4 and I am sooooo excited for season 5. To anyone who wants to know if they can start watching from this season: You Totally Can. You may miss stories like Jang Gyu Tae, dr Han & detective Kang\\'s cute love stories, etc but it\\'s okay. In season 5, the story cases are able for new viewers to watch and understand well (because mostly each case is new story & each case story usually for 2 episodes in this season); HOWEVER, watching season 1-4 is Totally Worth It. Recommend it! Just try season 1 first then...I feel like you will continue to season 2, then season 3, season 4 and then congrats, you are in season 5 XD I was just bored and looking for something to watch in netflix, I just tried watching God\\'s Quiz but i never thought that i would finished season 1 to season 4 in just 5 days!! This is really an amazing series! Once i tried it, i never stop watching. I really like detective Kang and Dr. Han\\'s love story, it\\'s cute. I love this drama so much but sadly season 5 is about to end, i just hope that there will be season 6 and i am really looking forward to that! Ryu Deok Hwan is an underrated actor, he is very talent. In the previous seasons, Han Jin Woo was cute and he was much more mature through each season but still kept his wit until season 5. Love it! I started watching season 5 and went back to watch the older seasons, wonder why I didn\\'t watch this drama before, it\\'s very good, this show can go on forever without any problems, each season is a different case so OCN can keep making new season and I don\\'t mind at all. Also, Ryu Deok-Hwan is a good actor and very cute at that, hope to see him more in god\\'s quiz season 6,7,8,9,..... I would be very sad if OCN stop making new season for this drama. love this drama. Been fan of Korean dramas for the last 7 years and this drama is one of my favorites. Unpredictable mysteries never will make you bored. Want to see Deok Hwan more often in new dramas. Also, I like his hairstyle in this season:). Kim Jae Won Oppa look different here.. I wish i can see Dr Seung Do again (Kim dae jin) he\\'s so hillarious even he\\'s so pervert XD he played in God Quiz since Season 1-3 and in Season 4 Dr Han keep talking about him like as asking sugestion about hacking or anything Related to the Case I wish Lee Donghae would come back somehow. Even if it\\'s impossible. I miss seeing him with Ryu Deok Hwan (legit the purest characters I\\'ve ever seen ughhh I want him back). I miss seeing him get all excited about being useful to a case, being just like his mentor, and just being THERE. It\\'s painful still. Very, very painful. Also, I wonder if Kim Jae Wook could make a cameo. His villain portrayal as Mo Tae Gu was outstanding albeit fucking terrifying. It\\'d be interesting seeing how real-life best friends would play protagonist-antagonist. But fr, bring back the pure puppy mentor-apprentice duo. If he\\'s gonna be just like his idol, he should follow in his footsteps of dying multiple times and then coming back. If the villain of the first season could get an undeserved second chance, why can\\'t he? Just let him be with his beloved ME team, investigate cases, and LIVE. Please... With all the shady shot going on, cloning organs, and almost impossible things in the series- can bringing back Si Woo please happen??? @ writer @ producers @ everyone I just knew Ryu Deok Hwan from Miss Hamurabbi.. Then, just tried watching Quiz from God Reboot as the title was appealing to me. Never knew that this is Season 5! So, I spent a few days watching Season 1 to Season 4 and really grateful that they make Season 5. is his hair style popular in Korea? cause the male lead in secretary kim also have similar hair style too, I prefer his appearance from episode 1 and 2, I personally think this new hair doesn\\'t suit him, it makes him look a bit girly. @visiter I think you can but still you\\'ll miss a lot like the two main characters are dating already now and how the main character is on the run after season 4...other seasons are really fun and amazing too (same writer with Kdrama \"Good Doctor\"). This season, different writer though so I am still figuring it out...but so far it\\'s good Is it possible that i watch this season without watching Other seasons? I don\\'t like Kim Jae Won\\'s role in this drama? grrrrrrrr ... subs *sigh* Omg finally after four years!! I hope they do the same with missing noir m?? I will watch this drama for sure! Ryu Deok Hwan, I really like this actor. Now he is a lead. The long waits it\\'s over excited to watch season 5 I love Kim Jun Han after the drama \"Time\", he is so good!!! Fighting! for people who are new to this drama: My years of waiting is worth it  Do I need to watch the previous season to understand this new God\\'s Quiz? Cant wait Does Nae-sang Ahn (Detective Bae Tae-shik) make an appearance or at least a guest cameo again? I know they can throw him in there and it would stir lots of things up especially with Detective Hee. Both detectives can argue with each other like an old married couple and then ask Han what his idea would be in an awkward funny evasive escape if need be. lol Didn\\'t expect to get a season 5. Finally! kim jea won too!!! wooaaah deabbaaaakkkkk!!! Windimae: agree with you!!! Waiting for Team Ten to start another srason huaaaa wow season 5, cant wait, wish to see more chemistry btw the two leads??? wish to see more chemistry btw the two leads Omg I\\'m crying deokhwan is back and quiz of god holy crap I\\'m so happy Ah sh*t!! I am pump up! He looks super good in that teaser at the end! is it hard to follow the story line without watching the previous seasons? absolutely excited for this! yay! I never thought they\\'d reboot God\\'s Quiz yipee!!! I am looking forward to watch this drama! Omg!!!!! OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh yesss!!! Ryu Deok Hwan, Yoon Joo-hee, & Park Jun-myun, the original casts reunion after 4 years here... HanGang Couple is back!!!! Finally after 4 years. its real super excited for this comeback cant wait to see this drama again. Yeaaa!finally after a years waiting for quiz from god:) they should include yoon joohee again love the chemistry between her and DeokHwan from season1 to season4 *O* waiting for VProsecutor and TeamTen nex season pls OCN TT TT Finallyyyyyyyy....... Oh my!!! I am a fan of God\\'s Quiz season 1 - 4...FINALLY!!! After loooooongg waiiittt *cry* Finally!!!!',\n",

       "  'comments': 'i just wanted to know who is hana actors and i find nothin The drama is good and watching it was like a roller coaster ride...but...wth was with the final episode!? for those of u wondering if u shld start this drama. my ans to u is a resounding YES!!!!!! only if u dont mind watching a drama with zero love story and it being solemn throughout. The length of the drama was just right for me and i actually finished the drama without getting sick of or bored of halfway which happens q often for me when i watch other dramas. Great mystery drama. Give it a go. You won\\'t be disappointed. Best thriller drama ever but the ending is sucked and unrealistic...cast is ok...we need a sequence of this drama I mean a normal human being would have been very angry. For crying out, the woman buried her Five year old sister in the house they all grew up and changed the sister with her own child. Even the dad is what I don’t understand, allowing your child to die like that after seeing the bruise on her skin and still burying her like that without reporting her to the police. I thought parents were supposed to have unconditional love for their child. I am so angry right now This drama was quite good but the ending part was rubbish and too rushed. How can Woo Kyung not be that angry, she wasn’t even really angry like that. Still allowing her daughter play with her step mum saying her daughter loves the grandma what excuse is that? The ending was just not right at all why do i feel that i need more of this kind of drama. its just that in the end everything is in their place and normal again. so sad that i want the episode to extend more? The staggering amount of thrill and chill in this drama is kinda unhealthy but just adequate. I like that it built much awareness that child abuse is indeed a serious problem and the victim of domestic violence have to be saved, despite in reality saving them is not easy. At least, this drama has brought a fresh story and plot twists, which put a lot of enlightening ideas on how cruel the world might be. Props to the writer and all the actresses and actors which insanely nailed this drama with their class act! The MVP is Woo-Kyung tho! She acted flawlessly, and how she portrays the emotion was just incredible! I had to watch this because of Nam Gyu Ri and I was not disappointed! She’s one of my favorite actresses, she’s so gorgeous and talented I’ve been waiting for her to be casted in a show or movie. This show is a gem. I’ve seen a lot of complaints about this drama being too dark, with lack of romance. But I think its nice to watch something different. I was hoping for the two cops to bond a bit more. The writing is a masterpiece and the acting from all the actors is well worth the watch. It’s so twisted and has you guessing till the very end! OMG! This drama is a masterpiece. I fell in love with it from the first episode. So many mysteries and everything is made in a way that will keep you hooked until the end. I\\'m so sad that it will end soon cause I alsolutely adore it. Children of Nobody deserves some awards and those child actors are so talented. For those of you who love serious, mature, dark and mysterious korean dramas, this will be perfect for you to watch. What a great drama! Just great! From first episode till recent 30 it\\'s so exciting to watch. Writer did a excellent job the same director and of course cast. I can\\'t wait for last final episode. Really poor children, there are so many emotions in this show. Damn...I cried like no tomorrow for episode 30...What a revelation. I currently watching episode 11 and doesn’t it obvious the killer is the cha woo kyung’s psychiatrist yoon tae joo? Well I hope Red Cry is Eunho. He fitted it so perfectly. I hate watching this drama as it was so intense. I keep on seeing N as the RC. From the ep of 24 the good person mask and the website has been deleted in Song Ho Min\\'s office, and N is pretty much good in IT so i would assume N is RC and keeping all of his identity by using Song Ho Min. As you can see N has been abused from head director and even the director when he was a kid and i am pretty sure he would have grudge onto them. He becoming RC as he has been traumatised by the abusive director and does not want any of the kids to be suffered as what he has. That is what my opinion. this is one of best k drama i\\'ve ever watch. great story, nice cinematography, great acting (kim sun ah & nam gyu ri)... enough to make you captivated. it\\'s not a typical k-drama, it has the vibe of hollywood tv series. kim sun ah & nam gyu ri makes me surprised. they\\'re so different from their characters in kdrama before. especially nam gyu ri, i never imagine she can be so cool as a cop. It\\'s one of the best drama I\\'ve ever watched <3 It became my favorite drama really fast One of the best. The Koreans surely missed out an amazing drama and those ratings are lies haha. Don\\'t let those low ratings prevent you from watching good quality dramas. Can We Talk About Cha Hak-Yeon\\'s Acting Tho???:\\') what a shocking episod @jd i also thought the same thing that RED cry could be yoon tae joo... Cause she might have told him about some of her cases... While he was counseling her.....and BTW the more i watch this show the more i fall in love with lee yi kyung oppa.... And the more handsome he gets....he has a whole new side to him not the smiley characters he used to play Spoiler possible..... Awesome mystery drama. I suspect N is the Red Cry.. At episode 20... Possible spoilers alert. I watch this drama even without being translated. The plot is interesting the lead actress is very good I have no issue with the other actors so I watch this drama with interest. The ratings don\\'t influence me at all. Based on the recent episode, I don\\'t think Red Cry really has a good person\\'s face. I know it\\'s blurry but it looks like he(definitely a he with how he moves and how strong he is) is wearing some sort of mask. If they introduced a new male character in the next episodes, I\\'m definitely suspecting him xD I don\\'t care what kind of rating other people would give this show. All I know is that it sure is one heck of a good mystery drama. Originally watched it because of N, but just like Tunnel (also one of his previous dramas), I seriously enjoyed it, even though the cliffhangers are so stressful most of the time xD The cast are all good, which makes you question if one of them is really Red Cry because each one of them are sort-of two-faced and the plot is so intriguing and you\\'ll get so into it as if you\\'re a detective yourself. Definitely worth recommending!!! I think the Red Cry is Cha Woo Kyung\\'s Step Mom. Cha Se Kyung knows all the truths. And when Cha Woo Kyung mention about incidents around her, Cha Se Kyung responded. I really love all of the character and every plot is beautiful!! I think this drama doesn\\'t get a good rating because there are other k-dramas that actually casts by more popular Korean actors and actresses, running at the same time. I don\\'t know the story about the other k-dramas, but I prefer to watch this kind of drama and salute for Kim Sun A, Li Yi Kyung, every actor, actresses, and the crew for making this drama not only the story\\'s very interesting but also there are many moral value specially about children on it. KEEP ON THE GOOD WORK, FIGHTING!! This drama is so great, I dont get why the rating is low. This is really cool. Well written, well acted. The song for when gyuri goes in the club is called insane by flume What\\'s the song in Eps 11-12 (Ep 6) when Nam Gyu-ri\\'s character went to a club? Thank you I think redcry is Cha Se kyung, Cha Wook kyung\\'s sister. Haha! It\\'s just a hunch. It\\'s impossible at first because she is being shown as in a coma state but when the drawing of the girl was shown to her accidentally, she reacted like she was surprised and emotional. It\\'s impossible for patients who are comatose to react that way because even if they can open their eyes, they have a flat affect. And it\\'s possible she knows everything about Cha Wook Kyung\\'s daily life because she might have shared her daily life to her comatose sister just by talking to her. Also during the earlier episode,Cha Wook Kyung was surprised to see her sister\\'s eyes open, it felt like a foreshadowing of the forthcoming episodes to come. I don\\'t understand the low ratings at all. This is such a nice drama the set feels so eerie like a movie and the actors act naturally without any force. Anyway, Cha Wook Kyung seems like a good fit to be a killer with all her repressed memories and emotional burden being hidden inside. If it\\'s not her, it may be her sister. Because when she accidentally saw the drawing of the girl she blinked many times and her eyes were tearing up. People who are comatose can be aware of their surroundings but are not able to show emotions or react because the autonomic nervous system functions are also depressed when you are in a coma state. I also think both of them suffered the same abuse when they were children. @Sooyi, your assumption actually makes sense. Comes to think of it, no one else has access to woo kyung\\'s poems collection on her shelves other than those close to her. The detectives always said murder happened around woo kyung\\'s center all the time. What if Red Cry was on killing spree not because he hates child abusers, but instead hate woo kyung and her poems? What if Woo-kyung\\'s ex-husband was Red Cry? It\\'s because in episode 13-14, Woo-kyung wondered how Red Cry had access to information about her sessions with So-ra\\'s mother and then it was revealed that during computer security checks, all the data from the computers of her workplace was collected and was given to Woo-kyung\\'s boss. And he said that his administrator IDs were known to several people. Anyway, Woo-kyung\\'s ex-husband happens to be the Vice President of an IT (Information Technology) company, and I don\\'t think his job title is just some decoration after the revelation about the data. love it so far (Ep.4)...the atmospheric intensity was great...what i like is the plot is a creeper and not splashed out too early in the episodes, so it keeps you wondering what will happen next and puzzling the pieces together. There also normal everyday drama/crisis is added in (cheating husband, missing his ex-girlfriend and family issues)...mixed that alll in with a pretty hard headed assistant cop (Jeon So-Young) and a comedic office assistant (Lee Eun-Ho) and you got a suspence/thriller/rom-com drama worth watching:) What is actually cha se kyung role? I saw that she was looking weirdly at the cha woo kyung kids imagination . There must be some connection between them. Whk is that kid actually? Omg my two favorite actors in one drama.N and lee yi kyung Fighting ... Love this drama 9/10 Wowww it became more intense... but at the same time i feel bad for cha wookyung daughter lol.. her mon busy saving others child.. eunho character really confusing me.. i hope he\\'s not a villian.. and woo kyung husband is totally garbage lol..he just leave her wife for another woman.. i can\\'t wait for more episode!! I want to know who is \\'redcry\\' i wanna see more abt detective jeon soo young..but story only focus how detective kang protect wookyung n the children?really wookyung stepmother is evil..but how can wookyung go left her own daughter to her while she busy with other childs at outside.n last thursday i felt yikyung hv interest toward kim sun-ah.and how can he left her just go with the conselor.even he put her safely to her home..its make me uncomfortable, is it make sense to hv romance?pls focus with the new cases evryday!! how can the detective to investigate with no asistant but together with conselor only?its not like working but dating! What\\'s the song in Eps 11-12 (Ep 6) when Nam Gyu-ri\\'s character went to a club? Thank you I wonder if Cha Hak Yeon got an antagonist character I want to see Park Bok Ja so i will watch it. I just love this drama. The acting is superb! The storyline keeps me wanting more!!! But, I hate the husband for leaving Cha woo kyung when she is in a such fragile situation. Are all men like that? Hahaha... selfish husband indeed. All he thinks off is is \"needs\". She is better off without him and she becomes stronger and believes in herself. Real time situation! It\\'s not everyone\\'s cup of tea, but it really is intriguing. Te first four episodes had a really intense feeling that is really interesting! The writer got me thinking of what would happen next but none of my imagination was right. A bit confusing somehow, but really makes me curious, so kuddos to the writer so far! For you thriller or mystery seeker, here\\'s your cup of tea! Oh, and if you have watched Signal, this drama has that kind of intense vibe, but obviously with a totally different story line. for those who want to know the song that plays in the car \"Agnes Obel - the Curse hello, can anybody tell me the title of the song when kim sun ah was driving in the tunnel in eps 1? hello, can anybody tell me what\\'s the title of the song when kim sun ah driving her car in the tunnel and then got a car accident in eps 1? After watching the 3rd and 4th episodes, i gotta say, this drama keeps taking a darker turn every episode. The writers aren\\'t holding back and are not afraid to show scenes which can even be called disturbing for some. I feel ji hun and soo young ( the male and female police officer respectively) and their personalities in the drama help to make things a little bit lighter. However, the plot is very interesting and keeps you hooked. I love how every scene makes you feel some kind of strong emotion. Anger, grief, sympathy. Very raw and no sugar coating. This drama may not be for everyone but i would recommend everyone to give it a watch and see for themselves. just watched 4 episode and this drama really recommended guys.. Yi kyung oppa fighting..sarangheyooo.... yeah.. this drama is kinda excited cause i cant forget how funny yi kyung in waikiki thats made my stomach hurt for laughing so much.. cant wait to see this drama soon Yes! Yi Kyung in a serious drama! I can\\'t wait to see how I can forget about the silly and immature actor Lee Jun Ki and GWAENCHANA GWAENCHANA. This drama looks very interesting! I can’t wait to watch it:) @CreatorWu yeah!?I find it amazing and cool but I hope to see son seung won in another drama too like them! Why are all the Waikiki cast members in productions right after each other lol who is girl which her clothes grabbed by detective kang hand? In 00:46 in third teaser?is it kim sun-ah or nam gyu-ri?? Lee ki young..i still have his image lingers as \\'stupid go daek jin\\' in my go back couple? OMG, I am not waiting,,, Kim sun ah, As I read the synopsis I recalled the drama Laughter at Waikiki and how he was supposed to act as prosecutor but instead got the role of a thug:D:D:D Finally on the right side... Fighting Lee Yi Kyung oppa! <3 My sweet, lovely baby, Yi Kyung. My future husband...I love you so much <3 I’ll definitely watch this drama 4 Nam Gyu Ri I’ve missed her so much??♥️ Its strange that lee yi kyung drama airing after his ex drama jung in sun Omg! Can\\'t wait. I love this both main leads and the plot is quite different and rare. YES!! Lee Hi Kyung finally getting a lead AND I hope, SOOOO hope, Kim Sun A takes the female lead role! I love them both!! (That photo of Yi Kyung, though...it is one bird short of a Flock of Seagulls, you could say, and the sultry eyes and washed out insomnia makeup is just too much for such a bright-faced cutie!) Kim Sun Ah, please confirm!! Finally Yi-Kyung is getting a leading role yes, yes ,yes. Please accept Kim Sun-A.',\n",

       "  'comments': 'I just hate that the writers and directors lied to us about the plot and who the main male actors was but apart from that I really enjoyed the drama, I did ship hyuk and sunny because of their great chemistry. just where is wang shik in the last 2 or 3 episode? i don\\'t think that is the real na wang shik They actually extended the drama. Korean endings are never full endings. What should have been resolved was. I usually don’t love corruption and people with money dramas but this is awesome. Thrilling. I love how everything is connected and a surprise around every corner. I really like HaRa in this. Go Back Couple was okay, but this drama she really showed her talent. I really love this drama. Really disappointed with the ending its sad that this Drama has so much potential everything was going smoothly from the start I wish the Writes & Production could have given more effort cause from Ep46 up to the end everything becomes a mess & its really obvious that they were rushing the story I don\\'t know if it has something to do with the shooting schedule of the Actors but that\\'s a lame excuse. Again they could have done more effort with this Drama, Seriously what are they thinking about Na Wang-Sik & Emperor?  DAEBAK!!! Really deserves high rate also this is most the memorable Modern History Drama that I ever watch every plot & story always comes with an unexpected twist. I thought I have seen everything in K-Drama but this exceeded my expectations. The cameo of Jeon Soo-kyung & Kim Soo-mi was really priceless I hope that somehow they extend their exposures since their character played an important role. Good ending but below expectation What kind of ending was that for Na Wang Sik!? There’s no closure for the audience. Did the actor have to leave the show suddenly? SPOILERS If not for the great actors and actresses this drama wouldn\\'t have worked... the story was so messed up but it\\'s interesting to watch... the best drama, with amazing actors Silly story.. Great drama indeed! But the ending a bit disappointing. The romance between Na Wang Shik and Sunny seems to have vanished suddenly...Would have been better if it had ended with Sunny being with one of them alive (the other dead), whether it be Na Wang Shik or the Emperor. Love this drama sooooooo much.. the best! My mom and I binged this for whole three days straight, and honestly this is heavy and fast paced enough since beginning, a lot shit happened even if it was just three first episodes, which it did. Such strong characters, twistable story. My mind was blown. Slightly dramatic, opera soapy but overall is great. Directing is great. I agreed with most commenters here, the ending was kinda shit. I get it, Wang Shik had it coming but still, it was shit for last episodes. Sunny should\\'ve stopped the dowager from shooting him twice, shame on both the emperor to not use bulletproof vest and the empress\\'s delay to act on it. This damage dose has left some of us feeling uneasy, much we needed a damage control by seeing a video of epilogue (what, was it uncut scene or made up?) as damage control to our emotions. Season two? Not really, it\\'s over but an official epilogue is what we need, please. I\\'m still on episode 34 but I really hope the emperor and empress will end up together. The emperor\\'s character is not really evil to the core. He is just a dumb guy who easily gets fooled by people he trusts, who were the real evil ones (such as his mother and min yoo ra. That\\'s why he is so torn and confused. When surrounded and influenced by the right people such as the empress, he\\'s actually a decent guy. Dumb, but decent. Na Wang Sik should have ended up with princess sojin. SPOILERS SPOILER: TLE has ended but something still is in my heart , my mind. Mised theirs eyes: Bin, Hyuk and Sunny; depict to transfer their roles into viewers\\'s heart. i recommend this drama. 10/10 ❤ The ending is a bit mind blowing , but it worth to watch, i give 9/10:) I enjoyed the show, all our actors did extremely well. I really hope they receive an award for this drama. However, I\\'m not watching anything from this director again personally. The same thing happened with return and Choi Jin Hyuk had to leave the show, also, what happened to the \\'romance\\' between Sunny and Wang Sik? This drama just make me even more curious about the real Imperial Family of Korean Empire... Seriously I am damn curious about Korean Royal Instituted... I like the character of the emperor, he is evil, cunning, funny and has a very romantic side, at the end of the episode I felt sad when the emperor died. Overall i loved all character in this drama The drama was roller-coaster. And the Emperor, I can\\'t hate and love him at the same time and I cried for him . Shin Sung Rok really nailed his character. I watched this drama because of reunion of Choi Jin Hyuk and Nara but love it for the suspense and amazing acting of the cast. I felt a bit unfair for Na Wang Sik character as they didn\\'t conclude his existence. Spoil alert: so I noticed that Wang Sik isn’t in the last 2 episodes. As a matter of fact they talked about his character but didn’t show him, they even had a car chase with him but didn’t show his face at all. Also on the last episode when Wang Sik supposedly stoped the bomb from further damage by using his body, why didn’t they show his face or at least a “flash back memorial” like they did for Emperor Hyuk (who btw was 2nd male lead). Anyways he had a flash back when he was dying, (you know the flash backs to look back on their life before they face death) but why didn’t Wang Sik get one? I mean Wang Sik is the main character, and then all of a sudden he’s cut off as if he wasn’t an important character. And even at the end, when justice is served, where is Wang Sik’s justice? The success of defeating the royal family wouldn’t have been successful if it weren’t for Wang Sik. I hated how they just killed him off on the last two episodes leaving us with no closure. It’s not fair. Overall great drama, but hated how the writers killed off Wang Sik and then didn’t show how important he was especially to the Empress due to there close relationship. The ending make me sad. Imagine this ending: ^spoiler finale ^! Ok here’s my 2cents, I love the ending , I think it’s appropiate , pheha will die no matter what since he did so much sin he needs to redeem himself but i admit it was cruel way to die.the only weird end , they killed nws , CJH supposed to be main lead he needs to be present until last ep. if the writer can make him coma by hugging the bomb tried to save that one meeting or whatever, instead of being dead , the emperor still can pretend to be him and the story still will be the same ending. What makes audience upset was CJH can’t appear to wrap up the series while they put him as main cast. if he appears ALIVE on finale even for only couple minutes , I think the reviewers will be happier ( we still can’t ship bodyguard and empress tho, she still legally married ) But overall this is one of the best drama I ever seen . It’s unique ,weird , little over the top , but you guys should watch it . Well rounded cast , it deserved high rating . This drama was Super Super Good... I love the cast I like the chemistry between Jang Nara and shin sung rok rather then Choi Jin Hyuk ..... but knowing the emperor became like due to his parents action is just scary.... true life events we adults need to be educated and understand the child if not it will turn out like this and it will be very sad. Nevertheless awesome drama Highly recommended to every Kdrama addicts!!! Best I can say, is..nice shots of the palace. The rest is a train wreck, including the sickening portrayal of the \"Last Korean Royal Family\" as a bunch of dysfunctional and psychotic chaebols. The true story of the last Korean royalty should not be forgotten. I got really tired of people pulling out their handguns, and threatening to shoot everyone. Is this love affair with handguns a new Korean drama trope? Nice to see Park Won-Suk again. She shone in Hundred Year Inheritance, the best mother-in law drama ever. They even managed to keep suspense for 50 episodes by excellent writing, not some phony gun suspense. Tikha, the late queen skeleton has been revealed in other episode but I forgot which episode is it. I think it’s around the time that crown price reveals that he’s the author of the novel. It was all good till the last 2 episodes. They made the crooked emperor the hero and discarded the all time hero na wang shik. wondering why they had to extend when the story was going well as it was. they lost touch on the story with the last 2 episodes. could have been better with na wang shik ending all the mess with the empress. the emperor was rotten to the core. there\\'s no way that he can make people like him just because he has changed and forget all about the real lead na wang shik. This drama... oof. I enjoyed it, but it truly out-makjanged itself in the end. I\\'m satisfied with how it ended. It lived up to the title. Am i the only one who remember and wondering where the hell did the found of late queen skeleton with the necklace scene is? I wait till the very end of the eps but it didnt show up. Like, cmon. Thats the opening scene in eps1 but where did it all go now? you left me without a single explanation hh. Suneo . . We are about to end. . Love from indonesia. . After years there is no good k drama. . Love this so much.. stay cool Omo.... this drama is really daebak.... the casts are just fantastic. This drama really is so unexpected and unpredictable. The weird part is I feel pityful for Lee Nyuk, since he was emotionally abused by the father and taught by his twisted mother and therefore became what he is today. I’m worried about you as a person if you want the Empress and Emperor to end up together. It makes me wonder what you’re willing to put up with in a relationship... If have Jang Na Ra and Choi Jin Hyuk, you can expect a lot of twists and I love there together The worst drama I\\'ve seen recently .. really I can\\'t force my self to see the last two ep. with out Jin Hyuk .. how could you do that to him?! His role was getting smaller and smaller every week .. and in the end they didn\\'t even consider his schedule when they extended the drama for another week .. that\\'s too awful Can someone tell me what happened to na wang shik? Thank you? Yes! im rooting the Emperor and the Empress to end up together! This is my kind of action drama series were the female lead is not weak. I love the story coz the female lead is strong and knows how to fight back. Very entertaining. I love Jang Nara. Am I the only one starting to love the connection between the empress and Min yura towards the end of the episodes? I love how they used to hate each other and now protecting and have each other back #girlpower!!!! I want to see more of this kind of drama. It was well critique and it really made me want to watch it over and over. Jang Na Ra is an awesome actress. Every role that she took on in every drama has excel my expectation. In overall I believe that this drama is so badass. Well. this.is one of some drama when 2nd lead male stealing the show from 1st lead male. Nobody could complain..SSR is a great actor. He deserves that. I think after the empress, SSR will get more opportunity to be a lead male in his next drama. This drama is giving me a hard time. Hahaha??? Tbh they are all great actors, specially the emperor Shin Sung Rok. Hes acting is great he can pull his character villain or whatsoever hahaha. Everyone hates Empress Dowager, but not me. For me shes not that scary or evil, Min Yura and So kang hee are the baddest bitch in this drama. Im not rooting for the emperor and empress or na wang shik. I love the chemistry of the crown prince and hel ro, they look good together❤ Okay so what I\\'m hoping for is that they won\\'t kill na wang sik but instead idk send him off the get the bullet out of his head? Or something like that. Then we\\'ll see Sunny just being a badass and taking revenge and all that. And then at the end we\\'ll have sunny just walking and then someone appears in front of her and it\\'s na wang sik but we only see his back (since choi jin hyuk won\\'t be in the last 4 episodes) but we\\'ll know it\\'s him and they\\'ll have a happy ending??? Please???? Thanks to stupid extension now this drama is a mess . The original plot with strong male and female revenge characters were so good to bring down the royal family, now the storyline drags to nowhere and what’s the point extend the series If the male lead Na Wang sik can’t appear on final episodes. So frustrating .....horrible writer... I cant believe how people are still rooting for the emperor and empress to end up together? After what he have done? From episode 42-48 it clearly have shown that theres no saving grace from the remnants of their relationship. You all are annoying for still rooting for emperor despite of hurting people around him and oh sunny too. And i thibk you all forgot the bad deeds he have done in the past. He deserves to be dethroned and to be put in jail. Period The story itself is silly, lausy & dragging much. Choi jin hyuk is so awesome. I can\\'t watch next 4 Episodes without him. I want him to be in those last episodes but it will not happen. Well it will be the sad ending for a love story. I was rooting for na wang shik and oh sunny. I cant wait for the last episodes next week. I cant believed that choi jin hyuk is the main lead but i think most episodes are showing shin shung rok more. And this is great drama but it just lack of the romance should be at least in the last episode let the Empress falls back in love with the Emperor!!!!! They actually got the chemistry!!! Can\\'t believe some people in the comment section were actually hoping for Oh Sunny and Lee Hyuk to be together in the end after what he had done. The best ending for him is to face his punishment according to the laws, the same goes to Min Yu Ra and of course Empress Dowager and Seo Kang Hee. Really want them to end up behind bars and pay their dues (death for them is not justifiable). Tbh i don\\'t know about you guys but it\\'s been quite sometime that a drama is this much intriguing to me, every episode was amazing (i hope the last 2 episodes would be the climax that i wanted for if not the better). Waiting patiently but not too patiently to see the end of this! though Choi Jin Hyuk is the main male lead in this series, i enjoy watching Shin Sung Rok even more - he did a Great job in this one, communicating every emotion. love his badass role!! Too long but ill wait... I like this drama, I\\'m a fan of Choi Jin Hyuk but seeing the storyline I prefer oh sunny with Lee Hyuk and Ari\\'s daughter. I want them to be a happy family. I\\'m sorry Jin hyuk I hope the empress enda with the emperor. There\\'s not even a bit of chemistry between her and Na Wang Shik. This drama is so bad that it\\'s good. The dramatic over acting and ridiculous plot twists are exactly why everyone tunes in. Whyyyyy????? I decided to watch this because of Jin Hyuk oppa, but now I want Empress to be with the Emperor. Huhu Mian jin hyuk ssi. I still love you no matter what, it\\'s just that the two has more chemistry than you and jang nara have. Well, i dont understand how people love this drama. It is not too bad but the story itself is too cliche and the acting isnt great either. I really like Elijah but her acting here wasnt good at all. Also the production itself lacks a lot of thing.. like the blood which isnt even real and looks too fake. But then again i think all the actors are very charismatic like the Empress, the Emperor who is very sexy when he smiles (love his drama when he was a flight attendant). Also the little princess and the father and sister of the Empress are very funny and makes the drama flows nicely. I do like the drama, but labeling it a masterpiece is an overstament. I. Love. This. Drama. Looking forward to the next episode after watching this week’s episodes. The actors are good, you would hate them for their roles. Bravo! I love that they aldo gave it a bit of a comedy twist. Choi Jin-Hyuk is ❤️ I am really in total pain week after week??, I am almost regret that I watched the episodes as it aired it is really true torture Why do they gotta keep delaying episodes? Ugh. It\\'s so hard to wait another week. These final episodes, I better see punishment to Kang Hee and to that evil empress mama. I just want to beat them up from my screen. wow its a great drama I hope the Empress (Jang Na Ra) will be with the emperor ( Shin Sung Rok) THEY HAVE more chemistry!!! Min yu ra actually went to the palace for revenge.. how many bad people in this drama? great twist to have hel ro on empress\\'s side now #siblinggoals Are they really going to kill off the temporary emperor (the crown prince)??? Loving this drama. I am in the United States This drama is a must watch! So many twist in the story, I mean every episode have different attacks to the viewer! The Actors and Actresses give so much life to the characters! I really love the story! I just finished Episode 39 and 40! Looking forward what will happen next. ☺️ Shin Sung-Rok really rocks!!! If you have Jang Na Ra and Choi Jin Hyuk, you can expect a lot of twists and perfect chemistry!!! My God!!! I just love this drama!!! I love all the characters and the story itself. I’m a huge fan of Choi Jin Hyuk and I am so grateful to see a lot of people loving this frama. Extend please!!! Super duper awesome monarchy drama... love every episodes, the character is so strong,,, Love this Korean drama,the last empress one of the best??? I\\'m right now had just finished epiosde 1 but i still wonder who is exactly will be Sunny\\'s partner,Lee Hyuk or Wang Shik? Can\\'t believe this is my fourth comment.. The skull from the very beginning is Empress So Hyun Princess sohyun or maybe sunny..?? I really curious who the skull with a diamond necklace in 1st episode... Very good drama... one of the best! There is 52 episodes instead of 48 now as they have extended it now It gives me chill, seriously. I thought I wouldn\\'t like but I do. Shin Sung Rok is very good actor! I really hate Lee Hyuk. Wow! Amazing writer, directors, actors/actresses, of course the producers of this amazing stories! More power guys. Love from philippines but watching here in riyahd, KSA. Worth watching .. Jang Na-Ra..Choi Jin-Hyuk..Shin Sung-Rok.. d\\' best ever!!! The emperor is batsh*t crazy and sorry show but you won\\'t make me warm up to his character just because he\\'s feeling apologetic for now (God knows when he will lose his marbles next) and act all cutesy (rather creepy). His place is in jail or in a mental institution at the very least. Hyuk has to pay for his crimes. Sunny and Wang Sik belong together, they deserve justice and will prevail (still upset at the production for failing to develop their romance to its full potential/Where is the passion? It\\'s way too subtle and underwhelming). I really have a love/hate relationship with this show (I\\'m often on the verge of dropping it but CJH is holding me back and I\\'m not even his fan *weird I know*) I love princess ARI so much!!!!!!! As the drama progresses, I\\'m getting drawn to the bad emperor, Shin Sung-rok who doesn\\'t seem all that bad. His humane side is slowly emerging as he finds himself drawn to Oh Sunny. He also adds some comic relief from time to time which is really fun to watch. However, there is some delay in releasing ep.33 & 34. Can\\'t wait for this drama, one of my favourites so far.❣Jang Nara & Choi Jin Hyuk are great leads too. I must say that i like how their romance chemistry built between jang nara and choi jin hyuk ... Slowly but sure it\\'s gonna be good. How they promise to protect each other in silence. I feel bad to the emperor, his mother are truly a devil witch *the actress should win an award for being so nasty lol*. I do hate to watch an ongoing drama that very interesting, can wait every weeto see whats next. Hope they keep doing the good work til the drama end and the ending would satisfy most of us. This season is so good and is educate us especially in Tanzania.I accept Jang Na-Ra, Choi Jin Hyuk and Shin Sung Rok are the best actress and actors respectively in that drama KEEP IT UP in order to be a Champion BIG SHARO As much as I love this drama and Choi Jin Hyuk the romantic chemistry for the leads is not there. The side romance is much better. They need to just keep to the action parts Too much breaking things in this drama XD. Actually his majesty is not the worst he just got evil influences from his mother and min yoo ra. I hope this drama will have a good ending. Oh Sunny and Na Wang Shik look so good together!! Uff <3 I’m excited for the next episodes & can’t wait:) Lol this drama team sure wants to confuse us by making Hyuk be so cute that can\\'t help but liking him despite him being so murderous. Poor Sojin for being used left and right, I hope she will have her own happy ending! Wang Shik / Sunny all thr way (eventhough SSR is just too cute!) God bless you @lovelace ... Exactly my thought... Yes, sunny and Hyuk have more chemistry but he\\'s crazy whether his mum made him like that or not. His mum wasn\\'t there when he killed Wang Shik\\'s mum... It\\'s love that\\'s making him kind, he\\'s not a kind person at all. Y\\'all blinded by cuteness and chemistry. Wang Shik and Oh Sunny all the way!!! Why I don\\'t wanna forgive Lee Hyuk yet? Because I know he\\'s going to turn murderous when he finds out that Woo Bin is Wang Shik and that Sunny is in love with him and has been secretly helping him all along. Lee Hyuk will be out for blood so don\\'t get soft on him yet. Wait until he gets punished by the law first. I\\'ve been seeing way too many comments about how Sunny should end up with Lee Hyuk and it\\'s gotten to the point where its getting on my nerves. Whatcha mean \"he\\'s pretending to be weak\" but is really \"kind-hearted\". Don\\'t make me choke. Yeah the guy may be hot but hes a murderer, and a psychopath who killed/attempted to murder not 1 or 2 or 3 but seven frikin people! Yeah I feel pity for him. Maybe he wouldn\\'t have turned out the way he did if it wasn\\'t for his horrible upbringing, but that is absolutely no excuse to forgive the atrocities he committed. For goodness sake he tried to kill her. Stop trying to push her into a relationship with her attempted murderer. He deserves to rot in a mental institution with that bitch Min Yu Ra. It really makes me wonder if yall actually dig those creepy psycho dudes who look cute and support abusive relationship in real life -_-. Sunny and Lee Hyuk definitely have more chemistry. But that doesn\\'t mean they should be together. It doesn\\'t matter that his mother made him who he is. The fact still stands that he is mentally unstable and needs go to a mental hospital. Let\\'s not forget that he is still trying to kill Wang Shik because he doesn\\'t want to admit to the world that he committed a hit and run. Stop giving Lee Hyuk a pass just because he\\'s cute. Stop trying to force Sunny to be in a toxic relationship. This drama gives me a roller coaster ride.. The last episodes give me a heart attack! I\\'m lost for word with that confession... Duh! Woo Bin, i shrieked after i heard what you have to say to the emperor... ???? I don\\'t like Jang Nara\\'s character at all, I don\\'t know why she keeps bothering the Imperial family. Like just go back to your chicken restaurant. I\\'m sorry but I hate Sunny, she\\'s annoying. Lee Hyuk and Yu Ra all the way. They deserve the most to be together. Is there a chance for Lee Hyuk to be with Oh Sunny.. I love this drama so much, I get so upset to be waiting every week? feel pity to the emperor, he is a kind person actually.. but stupid.. And unfortunately, he has an evil mom.. I love this drama, waiting for another week is really annoying. I guess am abscess with it. I love Choi Jin Hyuk and Jang Nara this is the reason why i really dont want to start Kdrama while its still airing. Because i hate the feeling of waiting for the next episode. The feeling of incomplete & wondering what will happen next , it makes me feel sick of waiting???. I hope this will turn HATE to LOVE repationship ,Please it should be the Emperor Lee Hyuk & Empress Oh Ssuni. I sense that the Emperor is just pretending to look stupid & puppet of the Queen , but he is a kind hearted King Please why is everybody shipping Lee Hyuk and Oh sunny together? Yes, they look good together but please I ship Wang Shik and Oh sunny please! Want Shik is just amazing. Lee Hyuk + Oh Sunny is Love:) I really love Emperor Lee Hyuk and Empress Oh Sunny., I hope the ending will be in favor of them., They are so good to see on screen., Much better than Woo Bin., Am i the one who ship lee hyuk n oh sunny? The best k Drama so far.. All the Character played their Role perfectly.. Another award winning.. lee hyuk with oh sunny Best couple award for Jang Nara and Shin Sung Rok. I love Lee hyuk. Great show!!! Keeps me on the edge of my seat. I love the main characters too. I must say the writers, directors, producers, actors , actresses and the entire team did a good job. the plot jumping here and there in sooooo many level... its ridiculous, beside dasom, there is also park gyuri (former member kara) as woman on the bridge who tries to jump from it. Why SBS didn\\'t give any award for children actress? Princess Ari (oh aah Rin) deserve for that award!!! Her talent so extraordinary!!! I hope meet her again in many more dramas. I’m really stressed out because of this drama but I can’t stop watching it. Sure, a lot of people may think that the plot twists and the whole story is ridiculous but it’s addicting. It’s far from. reality but the characters made my blood boil. Also if you’re not good on handling cliffhangers I suggest that you should just wait until this drama is done or else you won’t be able to function properly while waiting for the next episodes. I should have not watched it.... If i were to watch this drama and pick a random episode from episodes 25 to 27, I might think that this is a romcom. I\\'m thinking of alternate or parallel universe that the imperial family is not that kind of evil. Too bad they were so wrong in this drama. Congratulation to Shin Sung-Rok for your award. You deserve to win. Yu Ra also best in acting. Your next turn to win another award. Best K-drama to watch. Raised my blood pressure while watching. This is so good drama..at first i thought this might not promising since the ranting is quite low but the rating higly praise now..i\\'m rooting this..surely recommended...this goin to be the best drama 2018.. Best ever drama with highly talented actors and actresses. Thrilling, suspenseful and full of twists. Wow, I cannot wait for the next episodes. All deserve awards and even more.Choi, Shin and Jang are too good to be true. Should get more awards for brilliant acting. The other cast are good too. Fantastic chemistry, emotions well portrayed. Unique, a masterpiece. I give 10/10. Hope this shows stay on top of others this season. Deserves to be watched over and over again. Highly recommended. Good job. Great drama with talented actor and actresses. The ratings show the success. I wish I didn\\'t start to watch it. It\\'s too hard to wait new episodes.... For me this drama full of moral education actually: @D: Sorry but LOL @ watching makjang for educational purposes. There are always bad guys in fiction and that\\'s just the way the cookie crumbles. If you want your children to learn morals while watching TV, sorry, but you\\'re just being delusional. Teaching moral values is the family\\'s job, not the scriptwriters\\'. The best drama. The cast are so good. Always waiting for the next episode. I don’t even know what to say about this drama it’s just a masterpiece!!! The ratings are so good I’m just so happy for them this drama deserves the best! The whole cast is incredible 2 of my most favourite artistes: Jang Nara & Choi Jin Hyuk. Can\\'t go wrong with these 2 established actor & actress. They just nail their role so well. I\\'m sitting on the edge of my chair every week. It\\'s crazy good, suspenseful & entertaining. Sometimes, the plot may not make sense but,still, this k-drama draws me to watch it every week. I can\\'t stand the scheming & cruel Min Yu-ra, which means Elijah Lee is nailing her role too.Thank goodness there are 48 mini-eps, so there is still a long way to enjoy this drama. Look at the ratings!! Definitely one of the best drama this year!! My heartbeat will become faster than usual while watching the series. Unfortunately Yu Ra has stopped the evil action. Missed u, Yu Ra. The story plot is like a sharp turn in a roller coaster ride but I really love it..I bet by the last ep the rating is gonna surpass 20% This drama is the best!!very unique and thrilling!!the weriter is very skilled and I give this drama a 10/10 THE BEST DRAMA EVER! this is addicted drama ever, last ep I watched on ep 23-24 gives the viewers all we want like sad, happy, tense, comedy, even romance. we\\'ve never know what will happen next eps, the curiousity getting biger, it feels like drugs I can\\'t stop and I can\\'t wait for watch next episode!! Oh GOD i\\'ve never been so addicted like this before! What a good ratings! They deserve it. And this is my top list and fav on going right now. Daebak! This drama is so amazing! This drama is getting more exciting...specially the empress jan nara is controlling herself..coz she want to give justice the death of queen mother....do you think the other woman really die yura...???? Maybe yes maybe not.... What dramas are showing the same time as this series? I\\'m curious who\\'s 1st, 2nd, 3rd in ratings haha So satisfying for yura\\'s demise. Yes but I really need her to kneel down in front of Na Wang Shik and beg for frogiveness. Everyone is talking about how this show isn\\'t about being morally good. I don\\'t know if we are watching the same show, but I think you are watching it very wrongly. Yes, everything is almost always negative, with a little twist and (somewhat, since the jokes are\\'nt that easy to get) funny part, but everything all points to mystery, thrill, action and a great plot line that all leads to a righteous victory at the end (even though it hasn\\'t ended yet, very far from it). I can already see it, even the end of the latest episode 24 \"Yu Ra\\'s demise\", already gives a hint of hope for our great Empress Jang Na-ra and Chief Guard Choi Jin-hyuk to be the one to win in the end. So this is makjang drama? Oh hell yeah! I thought it was a romcom (genre that i like the least). If this is a makjang dramaa with a serving of hot revenge, then I will definitely watch this! I loved Money Flower so much and I hope this has the same level or even better. Plus I love Jang Nara!:) this drama is ridiculous and insane. it makes me stress bcs of watching it BUT i dont know why i can\\'t stop watching it!!!! everyone in this drama are psycho and the female main lead is so stupid. but every end of the episode always makes me curious what\\'s will happen next. I have watched this drama from the beginning. This drama is different from other drama Korean which I had watched it. Jang Nara\\'s acting was great and she should be like that. if you are looking for moral or realistic drama than this drama is NOT. But if you are looking for Not so romantic between the main character and lead man, revenge, sad, and every human\\'s feeling then this is the right drama that you should watch. Thanks I read somewhere below that this drama isn’t morally good or whatever (@D) but like... if you’re watching this for morals then you’re on the wrong track. If you’re looking for a drama which portrays good all the time then you’re going to have to look elsewhere- just like not every drama has to be about romance, not every drama has to have an overly rightheous or positive point to it. Sometimes people just watch dramas for the sake of watching it and not to learn anything! The bloody synopsis is that they both seek revenge - I don’t know what world you live in, but revenge isn’t all roses and it’s far from being the “right” thing to do. Also you can’t completely judge it’s moral/values when it hasn’t even finished yet, the evil may never prosper in the end, who knows?? We don’t! If you’re going to watch this drama a) know what you’re getting into, instead of complaining halfway through. And b) take it for what it is. I don\\'t know why people say that just because a character it\\'s naive at the beginning and not quite smart cannot develop and get more astute since the history it\\'s done in order for the character to grow and obviously, you are not going to change overnight. The big people started being naive and because of hardships and experiences, it\\'s what,t made them became more astute and vivacious people. And of course, she will not get revenge so easily or fast since she has to learn first while all the other characters were already evil from the beginning and knew how those things work. Even though I also would like to see improvement in the empress, I also can understand some aspects necessary for the plot to work. Obviously, it\\'s choir exaggerated even the evil characters sometimes do not make sense, but that\\'s why it is supposed to be a drama, in which the things are over exaggerated not only the expressions or movements but also the cheesy romence etc. But anyways it\\'s always easy to criticize. Guys, this is a makjang drama - do you know what that means? The plot may/will be outrageous, impossible or even ridiculous at times, if you don’t have the capability to enjoy the drama for what it is then simply leave. Bruh, the acting is meant to be like that, the plot is also meant to be like that! If you don’t understand then now you know, if you still can’t handle it then that’s fine it’s not by force but objectively it doesn’t make it a crap show simply because you don’t like it or the way it has been executed. If you’re new to such a genre the first few eps may be overwhelming - in fact I even thought the first 2 (1 whole) episodes was a bit too haphazard and hard to follow for a start, but it really did get better with time. There’s a reason why it’s currently being enjoyed by many- look at the ratings. It may not be everyone’s cup of tea which is understandable, but it’s not right to mock or belittle the show simply because it doesn’t meet what you think a standard drama should meet. The Last Empress for episode 21-22 is quite make me satisfy because oh sunny is start to make a revenge. Even though its make me very nervous that she not able to fight back. I hope the character is continous like who is she now such like an innocent girl and answer every question with logic and always calm, not like before she bark with confident but nothing!! oh my God, what a good drama. I watch all korean drama so I did know which one is the best as a viewer.some drama, its hard to get what is the point, a quite bored. but then, its from my opinion guys! Ridiculous singing at state dinner in Ep. 9? I don\\'t know how much more I can take. The little girl and Sunny could switch places and no one would notice. Agreeing with all the negative comments about Sunny. Why would Wong-Sik want the idiot, I mean Empress, instead of the 2nd hottest woman on this show, Stephanie Lee being #1? The most irrational and unbelievable scenario I\\'ve ever seen! And even the romantic part was not what I expected! Or better to say that this drama doesn\\'t have a part in the name of a beautiful and exciting romannce! so disappointing! It could have been much better! this drama is so ridiculous that its so fun/exciting/intense to watch. i usually hate dramas that seem to be too over the top, cliche or exaggerated. but this drama will keep you on your toes and heart beating every minute. its so entertaining. i can\\'t stand watching this drama anymore. what a waste of time. bad writing, stupid dialogue, exagerrated actings, to name a few.. the reason why this drama is pathetic. the idea is big, but the execution is horrible! Some viewers expect Sunny to be smart from the get go. But how is it smart to expect an unexperienced young woman who grew up underprivileged, is thrown into a completely foreign environment and at the same time is in a state of shock to be so? A character needs to be realistic to be credible don\\'t you think. Otherwise maybe watching \\'Superwoman\\' would be more satisfying. Oh, come on guys.. Not all the princess are strong from the very beginning. Some were born to be tough, some others were hide it first then slowly burst, and the others learned from what happened around them -- to them. Everyone in the comment seems to be so irrated by Oh Sunny. I guess Jang Na Ra did a good job since all of u r fully convinced by her character.:) At eps 7 (13-14) and Oh Sunny character is so stupid or maybe Jang Nara is also acting stupid?! Cant stand it! Will try to continue... maybe there will be some smartness in prince yi yoon & sister Oh hel Ro characters. Woah daebak im start to liking shin sung rok and lee elijah!! Their acting deserve an award. Disappointedly choi jin hyuk didnt seem to be a main lead. He didnt had much screen time and part. It is the first time I watch Shin Sung Rok acting and it really amaze me. What a great actor!! Though I don\\'t like his character in the drama?? I like it when there are more bad guys in drama. Can’t wait till all die and go to heaven. - NOT. don’t worry viewers, good always win at the end.writernim just don’t copy the ending of Hundred Million Stars From the Sky, that was one hella depressing drama... Happy ending please.. This drama sucks. Oh Sunny will have people on her side. She\\'ll win over them by her innocence nd courage. She might not be smart but these people will help her. Na Wang Shik will still work behind the scenes. Oh Sunny only knows how to lament and cry. She is super useless. So a mere acting girl who could not even get the lead on her own wants to reveal the truth behind and go against the BIG guys. They are emperors and have it all. Of course, the story is going to make a way for her but it does not make sense that a naive girl like her suddenly becomes smart, talented and able to go against the many nasty tricks of the BAD guys. At least, she could have been more intelligent, more smart, knows how to fight, then I would have agreed that Oh sunny can actually do something to hold up against the big ones. What you think you can stand up to them for long. Oh sunny survived round 1, now round 2 of the madness is gonna start. She must have collaboration with Ari. That girl so smart and evil LOL. Ari!! Ari!! Oh sunny really stupid. Ok...I loose my symphaty on her WOW! Soheon (Shin Go-Eun) is waaaay better looking than Sunny. I do not want the girl became empress I hate her mother First episode the girl play in palace so i think she becomes empress The only character I like is Sunny\\'s sister. Everyone else has some sort of negative aspect. Sunny\\'s stupid. Her father\\'s greedy. The imperial family... duh. Oh Ssu-ni. Brave and reckless. You need a good scenario to fight those bad cunning people. But stay strong. I\\'m on your side. Love Min Yoo-Ra (Lee Elijah) caracter. She is evil. She is a director´s dream. Jang Na-Ra is beginning to fight back. She deserves better than traitor-now assasin Na Wang-Sik who is now playing along with the emperor and forgot his real goal. Can\\'t wait to watch all the episodes.I am literally dying for the episodes to be uploaded.. They never really told us what happened to min yu ra`s parents and why she became an orphan, i really hope that trying to vecome the emperor\\'s lover is a part of her plan revenge.. Wgo know could be a plot twist.... The real villain is the nanny lol i like the story but I think before the Oh Su-ni got into trouble, partnered with the Emperor, she must know what the Empress is. Here she like stupid. She is fool not knowing anything..she like puppet who don\\'t know how to discern characters of the people. When you are into that position, everybody knows that Empress has strong character and intelligent. Her characters and appearance should vary. She should have been better because she was getting dressed and studied. Even if the Emperor inlove to others, the Emperor must be fell because she is beautiful than others. The bodyguard who is handsome will be attracted to Empress. She have to be different someday when she discovered that Emperor has other partner. Hurt could be changed..She eventually prove that she is different. The bodyguard Na Wang Sik and Emperor will fight for the Empress because of love. But in the end Na Wang Sik would be chosen as her long partner. so choi jin hyuk is na wang sik updated version? LOL I\\'m already tired of the emperor, the murder and his mother. Such evil people. I hope Oh Sunny part gets better and better as she takes down the imperial family. I hope the emperor sees how he truly underestimated her. wowwww so intens I\\'m not Jang Nara fans but I think I love her in this drama, this time she get a better role than before. Lee hyuk and Min yura really deserve an award for villainous role, their characters so convincing. I hope the writer make the most outstanding revenge for oh ssu ni and na wang sik, I really want Lee Hyuk, Min Yura and the queen mother got punishment for what they did. This drama aroused anger within me just by watching it. It frustrating to know how a mother(shin eun kyung)is a threat for her own sons.she is all malicious and mean. Even CERSEI from GAME OF THRONES loved her children though how evil she may be but here she is just an insult to the motherhood. Two digits rating? I know how kdrama work to raise the ratings now. Make a trash discusting irrational plot This drama become more irrational and frustrating and the rating become two digits. I\\'m not even a fan of hers, but I\\'m glad Jang Nara is finally getting more screen time. I refuse to watch the earlier episodes because the emperor and his concubine are getting too much screen time. Now, I can finally enjoy this drama. hi im part of the \\' min yu ra deserved to be the empress because i love elijah \\' club The scenes between the Emperor and Yura are starting to get annoying! They\\'re getting on my nerves a lot. I\\'m excited for Sunny\\'s sweet revenge though I hope that she won\\'t stay miserable for the rest of her life. jang nara deserves the daesang. i may not be a fan of this makjang drama but i just watch it for the best acting. i think this is jang nara\\'s best acting to date. hwaiting, sunny!!!!! i really want to see the emperor and yura get punished for their sins!!! Its annoying to see the scenes with min yu ra and lee hyuk in it, but thanks to brilliant acting of Jang Nara I am really immersed to the character she plays I can feel the anger, passion, sorrow, and determination just by seeing her eyes and the tone of her voice, you go girl love you Always Nara ssi? After a while reading all the awesome comments, i gave i a try. Daebak! Before i wonder why tae hang ho only last until ep4, and wonder will he die too? But what a twist! Just realized after episode 3. So na wang shik kind of reborn. Hahaha.. This drama deserved high ratings because of its unusual plot. I cant see the role of wang sik till now.. im so disappointed with him.. he is not like a main role can wait for next episode..its really intense and very good drama. I really like the strong character of Oh Sunny? You go girl. Well.. its make me so angry....but the queen to much strong.. greget Honestly, this is pretty trashy drama but it\\'s highly addictive for those exact reasons. The plot twists are a little too illogical, characters are written mainly to drive the plot forward but the actors are top notch in the execution. I honestly don\\'t like a single character in this show, including the supposedly lovable Oh Sunni but that\\'s ok, I think that\\'s probably its intention. Really good drama. Very intense and cruel When I see the total episode 48, which ending in Feb 2019... my goddddddd!!! It is a torture to my soul!!!!! It is a rat race competition to whoever gets to the top first. Ep 14... Im confused why with cutting one\\'s hair wang shik tranformed from old to new wang shik. Has time passed? Did i miss it? Love the drama but i need to understand more. Cunning, scheming, everywhere. Can\\'t wait for the next episodes. It\\'s really a good drama I love this series but im kinda disappointed with wang shik!!! Waah!!! Sunny deserves to be happy....why???!!!:( Love choi Jin Hyuk and Jang Nara they are good actors. Hopefully this is a good ending. I started watching this kdrama because of jang nara... until eps 12 I found it a wow, it\\'s soo good to watch, so many plot twist, so many secret, how the casts delivered the story were amazing... It\\'s unusual genre for jang nara but she did it very well. Can\\'t wait for the next eps. I shouldn\\'t hv started watching it before it finished. I m regretting it so much .. The best drama I have seen in a while, it’s so good, every episode is so exciting and interesting. it\\'s a BIG WOW!!! to this drama..I really salute the script writer, the director and off course all chosen actors and actresses..every episode is very thrilling..no dull moment... So it\\'s a reunion for CJH and JNR after Fated to Love You.. nice drama..fighting!! Good acting lee elijah bcoz felt like kicking her ***.love the action-packed,fast-paced story plot.choi jin hyuk is super cool bodyguard..love this drama Good drama!:) The drama is more entertaining without to appear the empress to the screen. Her character is totally useless and boring, without salt and pepper. Yoo-Ra, Wang-Sik, Lee Hyuk are doing the best job for this drama. Even Oh Hel-Ro and Yi-Yoon are more interesting characters than empress is. The drama\\'s plot is great, interested in episode to episode. I\\'m glad the stories begin tell bout sunny and na wang shik. 1-3 ep soooo suck all about yura. Writer is very briliant. She kept CJH UNTIL ep 3 and all viewers curious where is the hot guys in this dramaa.. Good strategy!! Anyway the stories start develop and i love it. And now i superr hate yura and lee hyuk. I pray them burn in hell hahahahaha just kidding??? This drama is so good I love this Kdrama. It has such an interesting plot and great actors. The lead actress is sooo adorable. It\\'s so difficult to wait for the English translation. I love this drama sooo much. Currently I’m also watching God’s Quiz: Reboot, Encounter, Clean with Passion for Now, Priest, Memories of Alhambra and Top Star Yoo Baek. OMG, I really love this drama????? I hope this drama will be end with happy ending? Good to see Jang Nara again on the screen looking younger than ever, love your face Ms. Nara, what\\'s your secret:)? No changed at all after watching your previous dramas like Fated to Love, Go Back Couple, Highschool and others. Best drama ever?? Really love this drama, I have watched 10 episodes. Can\\'t wait for the next ep Does anyone know what the title of the song is at the end of episode 9? 1st episode execute how Ms Jang Nara act naturally though I\\'m familiar with her acting but still find it cute..she\\'s a natural comedian with a beautiful face.. For once I want shin sung rok to have a happy ending @miky, no that’s not their son. Na dong Shik is Na wang shik’s little brother A nice love story....The Beauty and The Beast! The Innocent and Power...Pure Love against so called rules... At first I thought it is nonsenss, but 6.episod was so funny I really started to like this drama. Actors are good! After watching all the available episodes, I am so excited to see how it\\'ll going on! In particular when Nara will discover that she has been used since the beggining, I feel like she\\'ll reveal her badass side expecially, in the synopsis you could see that the grandmother will die soon and from what I saw, she really likes Nara and *spoil* she had add at the end of the lasted episode that \"she is not an ordinary person\" *endspoil* since this event, Nara will impress us by her acting skills! let\\'s wait and see so excited for the rest of the episodes. I love this drama but Ima little confuse! @_@ Gosh, Poor New Empress Sunny and Bodyguard Wang Sik, They are both in love with the persons who are only using them And are really inlove with each other (Yoo Ra&The Emperor.) Wang Sik should not only get angry w/the Emperor,He Should also Dissolve&Forget his feelings for YooRa since BOTH YooRa and Emperor Lee Hyuk are STILL TRULLY INLOVE w/Each other and are only faking in case of his High Empress mother who are until now, still very against his relationship on YooRa. Empress Sunny should really abandon the Emperial Family and Go fight together w/Wang Sik who is her personal Bodyguard. i love the two main leads won bin and sunny but i can’t stand the emperor and yu ra. it makes me sad that they are running the drama for me. When you have villains usually you can’t sympathize with them or like them at least a little bit but i HATE them. I love emperor n sunny pleaseee make them together I just finished the latest episode but first, let us all appreciate Na Wang Shik/Won Bin\\'s hotness; he was smoking hot climbing and saving Oh Sunny. I watch this drama because of Jang Na Ra.. no one else.. she\\'s one of my favourite actress besides Song Ji Hyo and Seo Hyun Jin.. Why do i have the feeling that the Saphire neclace he gave to her is fake. any Min Yoo-Ra haters?? I\\'m in @Kira i suggest you to skip to episode 6,, it s more interesting on that part. I have to admit the opening is kind of horrible lol I’m in loviiiiiiing with this drama and it’s been long time since i’m Excited with a kdrama!!! I usually don’t leave coments but this one deserve!!!! 48 episodes omg I want watch all nooow! Jang Na-Ra <3 shin sung rok is really handsome I was looking for Shin-Eunkyung..my fav star? It\\'s been long time not comment here. I just found interesting drama again after years. Jang Nara, and Lady Misin won\\'t dissapoint us. All actors and supporting actress are so great too!! Miss.shin eun kyung you looks so beautiful????? Interesting twists of the plot.... keeps me wanting to watch the next episode. I\\'m excited by the fact that there\\'s a new drama depicts a fictional modern-day Korean (constitutional) monarchy for the first time after 5 years since The King 2 Hearts, thinking there would never been any such drama since, however just to realise it\\'s an anarchist drama... I would expecting it to put the monarchy in the positive shade, however what I saw to be an insulting mockery portrayal of a royal family. That one aside, I\\'ll just watch it and see how the drama goes... Not at all a fan of the director\\'s and the writer\\'s previous works though, tbh... I expected a serious, hot and passionate love triangle! I liked to see the challenge between the Emperor as a husband and bodyguard as a lover! Honestly, it\\'s disappointing that the emperor doesn\\'t like Ssu-Ni! I hope he will fall in love with her, otherwise it\\'s not interesting! I was looking for Choi jin hyuk.. then.. lol I expected a serious, hot and passionate love triangle! I liked to see the challenge between the Emperor as a husband and bodyguard as a lover! Honestly, it\\'s disappointing that the emperor doesn\\'t like Ssu-Ni! I hope he will fall in love with her, otherwise it\\'s not interesting! The premise interested me enough to want to start this drama (+Jang Nara and Choi Jin Hyuk as leads was definitely the main draw) but after watching the first 2 episodes, I don\\'t know what to think anymore...disappointing start to say the least. Cartoonish villains and dumb heroes in a makjang fest. Many scenes made me facepalm and eyeroll to be honest... Well, I will give it 2 more episodes before dropping it (Choi Jin Hyuk didn\\'t appear yet so) but the leads better smarten up a bit and the craziness tones down....... i thought the empreror was the herooo of this dramaa maigad???? What if later on the emperor actually fell in love with oh sunny, it’s not a kdrama without the love triangle/1 sided love lol lee elijah’s acting is really good and probably the reason why i want to watch more because she play the evil villain so well lol I\\'m not sure why this was such an acclaimed drama leading into its premiere, even with top actors/writers/etc. I just watched the first two episodes and it\\'s probably by far the worst drama opening I\\'ve watched in years, I know the main two leads aren\\'t in episodes 1-2 much -however this was so terrible I will be sure to not continue watching, moreso I am disgusted. Good luck to those continuing. Argghhh nappun emperor and his secretary. both characters really annoying. hmm I wonder who save Na Wang Shik and how he got the money to change his appearance The first actor that play Choi Jin Hyuk\\'s role is very good though, the emotion and strength in acting is good..Sad that he only appear in the two episode, but im sure Choi jin hyuk will be great:)  I have an idea about this comment: Hyuna said, \"Wang sik will change His apperance to another person ( Choi jin hyuk) to get revenge To the royal family.. .ooh....\"... And I be like, \"Aha! I see\" and I laugh so hard.. this is amazing drama I think.. WAAH.. but in the 1st episode, i think stephanie lee will be join with the royal family, but then i dont think about that again, and her character name Hello, so cute.. congrats make me excited with the next episode.. waah from hot scene to tragic scene.. The first episode was very good even without the main actors. I like Choi Jin-Hyuk but I don\\'t like Jang Na-Ra at all. So, if this drama would have been about a story between the emperor, his assistant and the bodyguard, I would have liked it more. Wang sik will change His apperance to another person ( Choi jin hyuk) to get revenge To the royal family.. .ooh.... Just saw the first episode OMG it was so intense! But looking forward to how the drama will progress. Shin Sung Rok is an incredible villain! So I just watched the first episode but wow the main leads aren\\'t even in this first episode much. Jang Na-Ra had like small scenes in the beginning & Choi Jin-Hyuk wasn\\'t even in it at all! It kind of bothers me a bit when the leads show up way less than the side characters but I\\'ll still give it a chance after seeing ep 2. Shin Sung-Rok-ssi Last time when you work as a pilot you lost your wife to the part timer lecturer ... Who\\'s exactly the main lead? Choi Jin Hyuk or Shin Sung Rok? @Ryushin Hm, despite he being the third person, but he actually accepted the fact that he\\'s rejected by jang na ra\\'s character. He\\'s being gentleman. He likes jang na ra\\'s character and know that she is suffering. But he never cross the line between the main couple. Wanna watch it already! Those trailers gave me Mr Sunshine’s vibes<3 Cant waitt!! Waiting for to watch The last empress with my favorite actress Jang Nara. Can’t wait to watch my favourite actor Choi Jin Hyuk ❤️ & Jang Na Ra. Actually I\\'ve been upset with the casting of this drama because Jang Na Ra is being pair with Choi Jin Hyuk. In drama Fated to Love You, Jin Hyuk became third wheel to main lead couple and that really made me hate his character. Then in this drama, they became pair and that made me feel really-really unacceptable. Jin Hyuk+Jang Nara+writer Kim Son Ok, thats gonna be a bombastic. Cant waittttttt!!!! Why they had historical background and I almost thought this is historical drama from the 1930 like Last Princess Deokhye. Ah, I was so excited to hear Choi Jin Hyuk would be doing this drama so soon after Devilish Charm. My only complaint about that whole drama is that the female lead couldn\\'t decide whether she hated him or loved him half the time. One episode she\\'d tell him off saying they had nothing to do with each other, then she\\'d cutely call him and be all shy in the next episode. Once the female lead finally stopped flipping back and forth between telling him he\\'s an unloveable bastard, and flirting with him, I could really get into it. I\\'m so excited for this . Choi Jin Hyuk, Shin Sung Rok , Jang Nara , Lee Elijah , Stephanie Lee... perfect combination:) I am sooo into this???? What Jang Na-Ra oh my God i\\'m so excited I, somehow scared for Jang Na-Ra\\'s lips XDD. Choi Jin-Hyuk gonna eat them alive hahaha. love it lols Hopefully this will better than CJH\\'s drama before (DJ). I commonly watched his \\'till the end episode. But it was disappointed me. After all good work, cz I love his chemistry with the lead female. Jang Nara! ❤❤❤ Can\\'t wait since Go Back Couple.. I like the cast and the plot! But is it modern since it said \"set in the present\" and not back in the days settings? I would prefer it to be back in the days settings. Oh my, oh my, oh woww!!! I can\\'t wait!! Finally Jin Hyuk and Jang Na Ra again!!! I love you both so so much!!! Can\\'t Wait!!! So exciting yay!!!! Thank u!!! Thank u!!! Wow...this is seriously happy news. Jin Hyuk finally getting Jang Na Ra\\'s love as he lost it before to Jang Hyuk in drama Fated To Love You. Is it historical drama??? Oh yes please! Jang Na Ra and Choi Jin Hyuk with Shin Sung Rok great storyline and I’m feeling this already; thank you for this. Daebakkk!! This is gonna be cherry on top! CJH\\'s Devillish joy will end by this month and from next month we will get to see him in a entirely tough character... Yay yay yay! And with my favorite actress Na-Ra ssi , this is overdose of happiness????',\n",

I love the plot on the issue of dementia and how it affects the family. Although some of the themes are serious, but they managed to deliver them in lighthearted ways. I\\'m surprised that this drama doesn\\'t get more ratings. As for me, I\\'m definitely recommending it to my friends. It was intentional. In Korea, they also have different accents. This Drama doesn\\'t deserve Low Ratings I hate the Writers rushed it, the phasing was going too fast perhaps Season 2? this Drama was funny, heart warming & full of lessons the only thing that annoys & awful is the way Jeon So-Min speaks I don\\'t know if it was intentionally but it was really annoying & cringey every time she speaks I feel like hearing a chalk creaking sound. Actually i watch this drama because have no choice to watch.... And i dont regret it.... This is really funny and warm hearted drama. The chemistry between the stars is really great... Jeon somin and kim jisuk oppa chemi makes my heart flutters..... The food really makes me hungry everytime i watch this.... One of drama that i will rewatch....8/10 cuz i have to wait a week for 1 ep and too short ?? i hope we can get season 2. This drama is absolutely funny, warm, fresh drama. From first episode until the last episode makes me laugh, sad, happy. Usually, when I watch drama, I\\'ll get headache because of heavy love story,, but when I watch Top Star Yoo Baek, I feel refresh,, can\\'t wait for season 2 with the same cast. The dishes from that island looks yummy and make me starving sometimes. I really wish I can go to that beautiful island. All actors are so good and their chemistry and teamwork is absolutely amazing. Simple story but meaningful...Writer nim,, make season 2 please:) this drama is good--it made me laugh in the middle of the night--all the actors are good in their roles ---I love this kind of drama ---hope that it\\'s longer -- Top Star Yoobaek is one of the most flavourful drama that covers many different genres; comedy, melo, and romance. It is very simple and pure kind of romance with comedic antics with deep message behind it. Some people may find it funny or hard to watch in the beginning but wait until episode 5. It will give you a turning point about that will change your perspective. It is very moving and thorough drama that tells the story of a man who came to unadulterated island with many charms and simplicity that touched the heart of the tragic yet complicated young top star. His life had turned upside down, but it became his healing journey. He brought us into his eyes, heart, and sou through his journey in island. It is one of the most beautiful narratives, and amazing cinematography that brought a lot of analogy on the character\\'s life. The island gave their magical charm to open and thrust into his heart. I am not going bring spoilers in it. It is one of the most beautiful drama. If we could get better English subtitles, you will want to have a DVD of it in your collection. I re watched it several times and never get tired of it. I really enjoyed Jiseok- Somin chemistry. They have amazing on and off chemistry. That have similar aura and have a great partnership. The ratings didn\\'t reflect this fine and amazing drama. The problem is the timeslot and big competition. Their romance is pure and heart fluttering. Some of you guys have mentioned not liking the female lead, and her accent is annoying. Here is a thing, the female lead wasn\\'t suppose to be beautiful and have fair skin nor have elegant voice. Kangsoon is rather rough, brass, strong woman with cartoonish mannerism. And her accent-- was kind of annoying foreign ears-- it reflects the island style- not elegant Seoul elite. It is rough, high pitched and loud accent. It reflects original and country style. Many Korean netizens recognise her mastering in satoori accent. Some people who moved to Seoul had to cover up their country accent. It gets quite embarrassing but it is part of them. Somin had to shed her image in order to carry her role. If you go towards to later episodes, she has become more and more charming. Jiseok is very good at method acting. Somin is more of character actress. She brings charms to her character. However if you see later episode, Somin\\'s acting has become more refined when she acts around Jiseok. They have good partnership. Their chemistry is very good. The drama is full of healing, heartfelt message, deep message, full of love, full of angst, and a lot of morals behind the drama. Each character brought magic. Sangyeob did well to develop Madol role throughout. Madol wasn\\'t a perfect character but he became more perfect at the end. Yoobaek in a way is a good person from the beginning, but because of the society especially in the city- it tends to put you under the microscope. They judge outer image rather than inner soul. It applies to many people under spotlight. It is a story of Yoobaek who found his way home- his true self, so he could be himself after everyone learned the truth in a hard way. It is real romance of the island that embedded in his heart. Believe it or not, you will fall in love Kangsoon when you watch more episodes, Somin\\'s charms will come through. Jiseok and Somin\\'s chemistry is actually amazing. I will never forget this drama ever again. I hope for season 2. =) Ayy the ratings don\\'t do this drama justice. I\\'m normally the type of person who always places ratings and the writer above everything else, so if the ratings weren\\'t amazing and the writer is someone I don\\'t recognize from a previous drama I enjoyed, I normally don\\'t end up watching the series. However, \"Top Star Yoo-Baek\" is an amazing, amazing exception. It was a good one, i just wonder why this drama is short unlike the other, at least they have 16 episodes. I started to like the main actor, he\\'s good. And i find it very cute the way they speak their native accent. Highly recommended drama! So refreshing, funny (ep 7 nailed it!), and natural acting skills. Gun-bae!!!! @Dr burn: Her name is Nam Bo Ra. Daebak drama~ the directing is calming, background is pretty, actors have good acting skill, and choice of music is good. I hope many people watch this. No one would dislike this drama Best drama with actors who can all actually act, not just pretty faces, and the supporting cast is great too. Lovely story, life lessons, and beautiful happy endings for everyone, best drama of 2018-2019, 100% healing drama. Great story, good job all the crew member. Love this drama.? Who is the actress who plays the doctor who have crush on ma dol? Falling in love with this drama..daebak? Top star yoobaek have great scenery n great culinary.. Waiting last episode... Best drama ever, make me laugh and cry. Very recomended, top star yoo baek have great actors, great plot, and great landscape of island. Top star yoo baek jjang? Very nice romance-comedy. Very like it. Jeon so min and kim ji seok chemistry are so good. Love love love ❤ Not funny at all especially after 3 episode. Not comedy. Below average 4/10. Big dissapointment. i love kim ji suk\\'s acting.. but sorry i don\\'t really like the female lead. so i decided to not watch this drama.. I love this drama, it\\'s healing, a little sad, but a lot of funny. The whole cast is great, and have amazing chemistry. Seriously Jeon Somin\\'s chemistry with Kim Jisuk is great and with Lee Sangyeob too, it\\'s hard not to ship both. There is no crazy makjang plot going on or terribly awful evil character like most dramas have nowadays, this is a nice realistic story. Big applause for this drama. It\\'s light and warm, everyone can easily fall in love with it. It\\'s the first time I see Kim Ji Suk\\'s acting, what a natural actor. He made a great bromance with Lee Sang Yeob and I wish they\\'ll have another drama with deeper story about their relationship. So Min has worked hard too for her special character, but I think she needs to improve her ablity to equal Kim Ji Suk\\'s acting. Yoobaek! Madol oppaa!! Hahaha..its really good drama. And the island its soo beautiful! Yoobaek sarangheeeee..really really love this drama,, 4 thumbs up!!! Make me laugh and cry,, really really love this drama. 4 thumbs for Top Star YooBaek. Can\\'t sleep waiting for next episode.. Dayum! 10 episodes? I want mooooore! Omg I really didn\\'t expect this gonna be soooooo good. All the characters are awesome, very effective acting. It made me love Sang-Yeob as a good eccentric second lead (since I often hate him with his villian roles haha). A new amazing side of him. He should take more roles like this and I hope he will get a lead role soon for a Romcom. Why does it only have 10 episodes?:( its so saaaaad that it will end on the 18th of january:( i really love the chemistry of the characters? and I hope it still have more episodes to watch:( i dont want it to end already:( i love Madol haahaha. he is so funny, i never expected Lee Sangyob can act so silly. This drama is so funny n entertaining. I love this. Im getting bored with male and female leads that often play in many dramas. But the actors here are refreshing haha. at least this is the first time I watch them in a drama., except for lee sang yeob I love this drama so much! I love the character building, the beautiful scenery of the island, and also their food! Each character have their background stories being told, so we can get to understand them better. I also love the flow of this drama, it\\'s light, funny, not too much conflict between the characters. But unfortunately this drama only up once a week TT. Can\\'t wait for the next episode. I saw the 4 released episodes so far and i love the leads, kim jisuk as top star of land, jeon somin as island virgin, pure, and strong, and lee sangyeob as top star of sea. Love all the supporting characters too, yoobaek\\'s ceo, staff and co-workers, and the islanders who all have individual personalities, are hilarious and warm. A funny, light, healing drama with beautiful island scenery, and mukbang with delicious looking foods they cook and eat every episode. Love this drama so much.. Make me laugh so hard.. But only one episode for each week.. It\\'s just like wait Running Man once a week.. Can\\'t wait it This drama is soo funny and refreshing! All actors are really good at acting, especially jeon so min. I used to love her in 1% of anything, but in this drama she just completely change into a different character, kang soon the country bumpkin! Kang soon is soo funny but also cute and lovable!! Thumbs up for jeon so min and the writer for bringing such a refreshing female lead character to kdramaland:) i love this drama its soooo funny........ anyone now where they film this drama????? wich island, its sooooo beutiful. This drama is so funny...love itttttt!!! I watch this drama just because of uri sangyeobi.. i don\\'t really like somin in this drama... she kinda overacting when she speak in dialect.. emm.. but again.. this is just my opinion. Will continue watching this because of sangyeobi. Thumbs up for this drama!!! So refreshing... the emotion touched the characters portrayed... all in just one word.. perfect... all the best to team This drama is so funny!!!love all the charcters. So refreshing to watch This drama is soo refeshingly funny, its almost like a sitcom. The leads chemistry is also on point, all actors are really good at acting. Not to mention the island food are to dying for, its almost like a torture watching this drama on friday night while you are on a diet. If i want to summarize this drama is the drama version of \"three meals a day\". Its funny but also a healing drama. A must watch for sure! ???? funny Why is there only 10 episodes??? Ahhh I want more!!!! I watched first episode and its so great. wkwkwkwkw so funny damn somin style make me laugh every time she show up. This drama so funny? somin unnie good character? @greta Cant wait. I miss romcom drama so bad. T.T Looking forward for this drama! Those 3 leads were variety show strars! I expect alot of laughter, spontaneous, and candid moments in this drama! I forsee tons of laughs????..cant wait kyaaaaa i want thissssss Jeon so min can\\'t wait to see you again? It\\'s sad it will aired just once ok? Waiting for Somin and Sangyeob to accept the role.. can\\'t wait for jeon somin & kim ji suk chemistry. Lee Sang Yeob accept too!! fingers crossed jeon so min pls accept the role jaebaall ~ Please cast hyungwon monsta x☺ It is only 1 episode a week, but since I don\\'t watch variety shows much, I am happy to have a Friday only show even if they very sadly don\\'t do like Money Flower/Secret Mother/Goodbye to Goodbye/Let Me Introduce Her and give us two at once (sigh sigh)... I am happy, esp.coming from tvN(!), for anything to give me more Friday Kdrama time!! Kim Ji Seok and possibly Jeon So Min being this weekly bonus makes it even sweeter: they are not making something cheap or experimental with idol kids but are just switching one day\\'s drama to a US kind of schedule. (It would rock I\\'d that episode happened to be over 90mins long, of course!!) Cannot wait!!! no wonder Jeon Seo Min was offered the role...haha... Probably 2 episodes on friday Kim Ji-Suk accept please OMG 1 EP per week?! Warm and Cozy vibes lol',\n",

       "  'comments': 'this is my personal opinion on this drama, so i hope it helps you if you\\'re wondering whether to watch it or not. What is the title of the song in episode 13 during their kiss scene? I love Yoon kyun sang. Great actor. Plus he is so handsome and tall. What a very sweet kdrama.. And truly live up to its genre of rom com.. Amazing chemistry between the two leads... I love this drama.. It was beautifully done and super love the romance... No dull scenes.. Both cute and superb in acting, I love Yoon Gyun-Sang as Jang Sun-Gyeol (whom, I watched in Pinocchio before) and Kim You-Jung as Gil O-Sol (love her since Love in the Moonlight)! Their chemistry is sooo cute! Amidst their age gap, it doesn\\'t affect me at all! Their acting is great and natural along with all the actors. Our family were so addicted with Clean With Passion For Now! We enjoyed watching until the last episode! Super satisfied and happy with the ending! Congratulations to all the actors, directors and the scriptwriters! If you love romcom with laughter, if you want to witness a pure love story with greatest chemistry ,great acting this is the best drama for you.All actors protrayed their characters well.Yoo Jung & Kyungsan \\'s actimg is so amazing once you watch it you cant say when its real /acting.This drama depicts emotions so well & even romantic scenes have high standard ,looking very real ,pure & passionate all the time,piece of art not just forced romantic scenes like many dramas.Kyungsan &Yoo Jung we love you verymuch,you two deserve best❤❤ I love u you jung-ssi. Your the most beautiful in my eyes. Sarang-hae <3 sarang-hamnida yeoreobun I wish there would be a drama for Yoon Kyun Sang and Yoo Sun. I wish they would be mother and son as they had that kind of chemistry in this series. All the cast potrayed their character very well..love to see both lead lovey dovey scene...great story but too much postponed every week makes the viewers losing interest to watch...i watch again with full episodes and i was disappointed because it deserves better rating actually... The main male lead is so cute, his like a teddy bear. I find him attractive, don’t really know why people are always talking about his weight, his body looks fine to me.;). His a great actor and he put all his heart and emotions into it, I really liked it. And the actress will she’s the best, loved her seen her childhood roles, she really is a great actress. I dont understand why gil o sol family put all the blame on CEO Jang..it wasnt his fault at all..he is just innocent grandson..The storyline of this drama kinda lose its track..at the beginning it was abt the CEO misfobia and at last few episodes we didnt even know how he got cured...quite dissapointed with the ending This is a great drama which give us some good life lessons .I love main leads too much they have the best chemistry onscreen & offscreen .Korean ratings may not good much but internationally &online itwas no one.First time I saw a couple who protrayed every scene so real,always smiling in their kisses not like actress is forced like kisses,they protrayed emotions so well those scenes were passionate,cute,full of respect all the time. webtoon great and superb! sorry to say, but the drama was flopped, kind of regret the ratings couldn\\'t match with the beauty inside and miss hamurabbi. OMG.. Kim and Yoon\\'s chemistry developed so well in episode 13 & 14. Love how they played with the kisses. Just fresh and easy hahah. And how their eyes spoke when they met in episode 15 was really \\'saying without words\\' cool actings. Great for you two guys. Hope you get good drama after this one end. Hi does anybody know the tune that starts playing in episode 12 at 34:15? Please let me know I’ve been watching kdrama for a long time now, many couple actor captured my heart but CWPFN is best among the best. the story is for those person that love heart warming story just like me. the chemistry of Yoon Kuun ang and Kim Yoo Jung is on top, i was a BoYoo couple fan before but now watching this two sweet couple on and offscreen makes me conclude that they have mutual feelings and attracted to each other or they developed love while filming the drama that their actions and eyes won’t lie.. lastly, age doesn’t matter when it comes to love, 12 years of gap is just fine? i wish they could be a real in time? Some of you may not like this drama but for me, this drama is amazing! I really love the chemistry of the couple here ( age gap issue is not a problem for me since I enjoyed watching them together) Its been sooo long since I experienced the feels that WFKBJ did to me. I am very thankful that CWPFN exists! This drama deserves an attention! They\\'re making a Chinese version of this I wonder if it\\'ll be better hope to see it soon. I really don\\'t like the 15th episode.. I really want to hug and console JSK in this episode. It breaks my heart, tearyjerking. The comedy romance suddenly change into tearyjerking drama.. T_T. Where all the happiness has gone??. Can\\'t wait for the final episode.. Please give us a happy and romantic ending.. I do not recommend it, if you love the sweetness of romantic dramas, luckily there is something better in the k-drama area. It started out as a comedy, also for some funny verses, then it took a kissings path to the limit of the rated forbidden, in which the female main really showed her young age and was lifted by a giant of two meters and with almost twice the age. Suitable for fans who believe this is a likely pair, or fans who like to see only many kisses, but to whom the acting and plot development not interest A great drama ruined by the writer\\'s decision to pull away from the original concept. They should have kept the focus on CEO\\'s mysophobia and healing it through his interactions with the female lead. Instead, the writer couldn\\'t resist an over the top plot twist that often ruins Kdramas and now we have to spend the rest of series sitting through this ridiculous storyline that was suddenly introduced and not properly explained at all. All it accomplished was me feeling bad for the CEO and disliking everyone else. Tbh don\\'t rate the mc\\'s and their chemistry isn\\'t that great either. Packed chockful with clichés. Although it has a rather interesting twist with the mysophobia in the end it\\'s probably not worth the effort to watch. The lead actors are perfect for their roles. However, they are not a fit for each other, which makes things all the more awkward. It might be the age gap, it might be something else. On top of that, the plot is so clichéd that I couldn’t believe this was a JTBC drama - and right after “The Beauty Inside” for that matter. At this day and age, this is very whatever and meh, and I think every single actor and actress here has done better than and deserves better than meh. Their chemistry is through the roof just the way they look at each other and teases each other. The behind the scenes clips show it too. And wahhh that kiss in the kitchen was romantic, passionate, cute, pure...everything was perfect! Can they go out already???? Kim you-Jung is absolutely amazing and so beautiful. And her acting is spectacular Waiting for the new episode I love watching this drama and still waiting for ep 14 online.. so happy to watch Kim yoo Jung playing a mature role now..OMG love to watch more episodes of this drama.. Episode 14 did not air as well so I guess another week to wait again. Really enjoy the drama.. the strory is easy to continue and makes me laugh all the time. So happy to see Yoon Kyung Sang and Kim You Jung acting. I played each episode again and again hahah. Looks like Yoon Kyung Sang gained much weight while shooting this drama.. He looks chubby, maybe because he is happy while shooting this drama. He makes us, the audiences feels so happy to watch this drama. I hope this drama will win many awards. Writer-nim and director-nim.. Thanks for making such a very good drama..?? No me too. I didn\\'t see any video of episode 14 online today and it should\\'ve been posted a while ago. I think that there will not be any new episode for today maybe it\\'s gonna be for next week again. Am I the only one who hasn\\'t seen any video of episode 14 online? I must saying im enjoying this quite lot Oh, how I love this drama, funny, romantic and lots and lots of kisses. this drama is Daebak. Kim you Jung has evolved so much and its surprising. Very good highly recommended show. Very very very nice. Good couple looking forward for they future and more show for both of them. Kim Yoo-jung and Yoon Kyun-sang. Love it... Ep 13 is too much kissing scene!!!?????? I super love it! Always looking forward for the next episode. One of the best rom-com ever. Very much hoping for a super happy ending! Watch it, it\\'s super worth it! Great actors! This is highly recommended. I love it! I can watch it over and over again. Wow.. everyone gives positive comments for this drama. This is really a very good Comedy Romantic drama. Watch every episode for 1 hour feels like 5 minutes. Time moved so fast while watched this drama.. hufftt Can\\'t wait to watch the next episode.. Anyeong.. I am from Indonesia and I have been a K Dramas for many years. I really love this kind of drama, comedy romantic. Laughed out loud while watching this drama.. Really. And the chemistry between Yoon Gyun Sang and Kim You Jung is really good. They played their role perfectly.. Can\\'t imagine if we have such disorder in real life, mysophobia.. Hahhahha Worth the wait This drama is really good.While watching their BTS and the drama itself, for me they deserves the Best Couple award. I am hoping for their higher ratings for episode 11 and 12.? Finally, they are in love *-*.. i love this kdrama,, looking forward everyweek to watch them,,, ❤️❤️❤️ How long that i\\'ll wait for 11-12 episodes cannot hold it???? I think the man named Do Jin is Lee Jee Hoon... What happened to this series? Can someone tell us why until now there is no episodes 11 and 12? Is there something wrong? Can you tell us if we should have to wait or not? Why there is no update about this? Whyyyyy?? what???? 2 weeks of missing ep 11 and 12??? nahhh WWWHAAT? another week of waiting . Geez Geez. Can focus on my Research because of this. I doomed. Haha. Sorry Prof. Just this once, forgive me. Haha. I love it! But it\\'s taking so long:( But L\\'ll wait no matter what. <3 This drama has been postphoned for 2 straight weeks....!!! What the heck jtbc!!! So in love with this drama but why ... This k drama is full of surprises and great old fashion romance and chemistry between the two main characters. Why is rating so low? People don’t know what they are missing. Once you watch the drama, it’s pretty addicting to see where the impossible romance of two people from two different world ends up despite how much they gain strong love and fondness for each other What a great drama and great chemistry but why such low rating. It’s a great drama about romance and reality of mental illness how love could conquer all. Yeah we have to wait 2 weeks for episode 11 and 12. Hope rating goes up No, i can\\'t wait for next episode 11&12 . It\\'s not fair When is 11th episode going to be telecast? Ahhh I’m so sad now since I have to wait another week for the next episodes!! And in my case it’s even more upsetting since the drama was suppose to end a day right before I have to leave to this 2 month even where I won’t have any access to watch it!!?? Please telecast 11th episode don\\'t delay ... why should we wait another week this is too much its been 2 weeks now ,that make me angers jtbc just like a greedy villain for postpone the January 8th episode. they don\\'t even have a reason to do it. let\\'s just say you\\'re not ready! Wait....so Eps 11 & 12 were postponed because of New Years and now they\\'re postponed again because of a soccer match.......? Why the ep 11 and 12 haven’t appeared? I think it’s too much for us who are waiting to see the next ep I\\'m waiting for ep 11 and 12 but they didn\\'t air due to new year and football. I understand.I love my princess yoo jung. I\\'m her forever fan. They could at least air just one episode instead of delayed both episodes for this week. Sigh.... What is the title of the song played in episode 7 & beginning of the episode 8 when she found out that the rooftop guy is actually a doctor and when they are going home together riding the bus together? Looking forward for this drama Love this drama literally probably my fave korean drama atm! can\\'t wait for the next episodes!!!! What a great show but why do we have to wait for another week waiting this drama for another week?! hiksss.... it\\'s hard. Cant wait to see the ending.

Watched to episode 8 and waiting episode 9 tomorrow. Drama with touching storyline and most importantly a well cast team. Gil O-Dol , I love u , Can u married me please oppa????❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ Love this drama so much... I like the couple too.... Sorry mr Rooftop ill find someone for u ok...? Very good drama and an amazing cast. I love it so much. I really like this drama... best story... @regina hi i guess the song title is, i luv u luv by yoo seung woo:) @Cay 3% rating is not that bad when the series was aired in a cable channel like TVN:) no chemistry.... help guysueee whats the title of the song in ep 7.. i will love you ~~~~~~~ i dont know the lyrics huhu:\\'< I like this drama so much, very funny in other way and it make me relax ...you are a great artists KYJ:) This drama is so funny. Kuddos to mr.Jang. But i kinda like mr rooftop too.. I watched this drama because of my cute and beautiful angel, Kim You Jung. I had been watching her since 3 years old until now. Can\\'t believe times flied so fast and now, she turned into more beautiful girl. First, I really can\\'t concur she pairing with YGS because he\\'s big size and older. But I was wrong, the plots and her acting are amazing make everything turned into wonderful drama. i really like this show, it has alot of comedy and mixed-chemistry everywhere. its family orientated and strict work ethics that can be abit \"too\" harsh at times! Acting is typical kdrama, storyline is a polar opposite rom-com, main actor/tress played their character well with quite a good support. So far theres no side storys that might drag the drama out to the point your twitching your fingers on the FF button. This one is really an awesome drama. At first i was hesitating to watch this ,but when i watched it this is super awesome this drama is funny af! lol kim yoo jung is super pretty too!! OMG!!! Waiting for the next episode 5-12 ???? I Like it <3 I watched this because everyone has been saying that it\\'s funny. And also because I\\'m a fan of Kim Yoo Jung. I\\'m a bit disappointed though because I personally don\\'t find this show funny at all. I smirk sometimes, but I haven\\'t laughed so far. If you\\'re looking for a comedy drama, you must watch this! I always have a good laugh for each ep! Very nice and I enjoyed ep 1,2@3...can\\'t wait ep4 up to 16....very funny. I liked this drama very much!!! Like both of them..??? Yoo Jung hwigting...!!!! I\\'ve watched the first two episodes and i enjoyed it so much!!! Gyun Sang!! Aw never regret watching this drama:) <3 very light, funny and heart warming <3 Can\\'t we relate this drama with Exo-Xiumin as sun gyeol and Kang Daniel as O sol in \"it\\'s dangerous outside of the blanket\":) After watching the 1st episode- this looks promising! Kyj is a natural actress. This girl seems so natural & at ease with her role. Yks too is good. Looking forward to this. For these few months, Rarely do i watch & finish watching all of the k-dramas’ episodes for this year except for a few. Among those- mr ahjussi & mr sunshine (a little heavy but truly good & exceptional)... i’m truly waiting for a nice & warm rom-com for a change & hoping it won’t be just a silly, slapstick comedy with boring plots.... let’s hope this will be different... Aaah~ I love the first 2 episodes, and I\\'ll definitelly watch them until the very end. Congrats Kim Yoo Jung for your perfect portrayal as a 20 years old Gil Oh Sol? And Yoon Kyun Sang as Jang Sun Kyul, he went all-out with his expression and didn\\'t hesitate to look weird? I can always trust your acting skill? I love this drama after 2 episodes; KYJ and YGS are great so far in terms of their characters and the storyline is chugging along at a good pace and I’m so happy with what I’ve seen that I’m getting giddy and light headed knowing that episode 3 is gonna be a massive treat! I really like this on going drama of Yoon kyun sang I really like him the way he act... What ever his rule in drama he can act.. that so well... Almost Yoon kyun sang drama or movies I watch it already.. that\\'s how I like him so much... And about Kim Yoo Jung.. I also her fans... Since I saw the moon light. Drama I start to like her.. untel.. now.. I can\\'t wait to watch the full episode of their drama I\\'m looking forward to both of you guys...... I\\'m always be waiting for full episode of your ongoing drama I\\'ve always support Kim Yoo Jung and Yoon kyun sang.. episode 1, when she run away with the horse mask, that scene was super funny HAHAHAHAHAHA It’s a drama of Kim Yoo Jung I’ve been waiting for it the longest time. I’m a big fan of hers, love her because she’s so honest and wise for her choices. Will always support a star with a inner and outer beauty. I also like Yoon Kyun Sang a lot, he’s a great actor. I’m happy he’s Yoo Jung’s partner, looking forward to their cute chemistry and Jam Rim too. CWPFN fighting The trailers are fun but have to start with episode 1 first with English subs to truly enjoy the drama. Looking at Yoojung is a bliss. Amazing beauty. Just watched Yoon Kyun Sang sing in Knowing Brothers daebak he\\'s good. He and Kim Yoojung were guests to promote the drama and they were funny and a lot of fun. I think its so funny.. Hope i enjoy it Tonight??????????? I\\'m so excited for Yoon Gyun Sang to be back in another drama. He is a very good actor with a wide range. He can play both protagonist and antagonist, serious and comedy and has a charm that when paired with any actress, you can\\'t deny the chemistry. I\\'ve watched his dramas Pinocchio, The Time We Were Not In Love, Six Flying Dragons, Doctors, Rebel Thief Who Stole The People and Doubtful Victory. His presence is felt in every character he portrays. huhu... i miss kim you jung so much!!Cant wait to watch this drama..? I’m digging this! The poster, the teasers.. they are perfect. Can definitely feel the chemistry. Yoojung-ah thank you for coming back healthily <3 Clean with passion for now daebak! So excited I can’t barely wait:))))) Csn’t Wait to watch this. Been waiting for the teasers and poster to and poster to come out! The chemistry is going to be great!!!!! The trailer is so cute, can\\'t wait watch this drama cool cool cool, can\\'t wait for this drama!!!! you jung & kyung sang i\\'m always support youuuu Kyun sang ♡♡♡ Wawww!!!! Finally? Some of comments here saying that yoojung and gyun sang are not good to paired up because of their age gap, like hello people don\\'t you know that kim so hyun was paired to taecyon and he was born 1988 and so hyun was born in 1999 and there chemistry was a hit to people so stop the age gap thingy and appreciate how good and professional this actor and actress are. I hate people who freaks out about this matter it\\'s not big deal at all because this people work and they are professionals. I was also anticipating Yoseop\\'s first male lead role in a regular drama (other than TQOR which is only 6 episode long, or short, should I say) because I really like his acting style and I love everything about him but to see people comparing him and Gyunsang doesn\\'t make sense. Miss yoojung so much!! I cant wait .. omo omo omo!!!!??? Warrior Myu Hool is here again.:) So excited about your new project. Fighting! I don\\'t like actors and actresses based on good looks, or their level of celebrity, am more concerned about their acting......Yoon kyun sang acting is one of a kind, not that he is really trying his best, but he is just naturally born with it...... Funny how I see a lot of comments here saying AHS is a better lead for KYJ because of their age. In Korea, age doesn\\'t matter in dramas especially if the guy is older than the girl. Also, KYJ\\'s acting style is kind of strong and powerful so I think paring her with someone who has that same powerful presence in the screen is better so they won\\'t overshadow each other. The underrated male lead now leads in a very deserving drama specially with his leading lady who is very talented as well. Its not i hate yoon kyun sang but i think ahn hyo seop will suit yoo jung better? . Its been long i wait for hyo seop to be main lead again since queen of the ring i\\'m so happy that Kim Yoo Jung is back! This is her drama comeback and i\\'m so excited to see her again. Let\\'s support her & this drama. Fighting! Patiently waiting for November Ugggh this is annoying me I have been waiting for Anh Hyo Soep and Kim Yoo Jung why did they have to change the main guy ugggggh This would be his 3 time lead role:) Maybe he is not really that famous like others, but Gyun Sang is great actor! I have been watch him many times and he is pretty great! I love Yun GyunSang as well as Kim YooJung! I can\\'t wait to see them togther in this up coming drama! soo looking forward! I think he is great actor! watched hiss previous works and it was lit! Young actress should act with young actors and older actress should act with older actors? that will be more good? why older actress or actress act with younger actress and actor? age are too much don’t look good? More than 5 years older are too much? no good I want Ahn Hyo-seop backㅠ_ㅠ Its his 1st ever lead role! And his age is proportion to Kim youjung! All the new partners of Kim Youjung are samchun or oppas older brother. It makes my heart ache because of Ahn Hyo seop. fighting noona! i wait for you!?? i waiting...i like KYJ with GS...FIGHTING.. Song jae rim should replace Ahn yeo seop Older women act with younger guys, why can\\'t older men act with younger girls. Kim yoo Jung is a grown up woman now, she is no longer a kid, Yoon gyun sang is a fine man too. Just dat he\\'s kinda chubby dats all, and the height difference though gyun sang oppa fighting. you are the best actor for me. handsome and cute in the same time. sarangheee Raon ah meet the rebel star wow!! Best of the best historical actor! Just waiting for their new drama in romcom!!! Fighting i know it would be an exciting drama to be watch. I dont care about the age! Cant wait on the!! I really love Kim Yoo-jung. I don\\'t care who will be pair up with my Baby girl as long as they get along with her. I will always support her. There are still many dramas and movies that she will be in. There will be plenty of cute actors that will work with her . Yoon Kyun Sang is a talented actor. And his face is not that old too. If he\\'s on a diet, he will be very very handsome. Fighting Yoon Kyun Sang, this movie will be a hit! I love you! Kim Yoo Jung fighting! Well, because it\\'s like that there\\'s nothing else I can do, because I love Yoojung I\\'ll keep waiting for this drama! Fighting Kim You Jung!!! hopefully your first comeback is satisfactory ^__^ I always support you. Ok Taecyon and Kim So Hyun(11 years age gap), Yoon Si Yoon and Kim Sae Ron(14 years age gap) both have chemistry, age is not an issue here, it is how they will carry their character very well.. if you dont want the male lead then don\\'t watch it, the producers know it better. And also don\\'t forget the hit drama goblin.. the main characters have also a big age gap of 12 years.. Yoon Gyun Sang Fighting! Why him??? An 18 year old opposite a 31 year old! Don\\'t these casting directors think wtf are we thinking??? They need to change him asap no amount of anything will make him look younger! They better change him like they did with yoojung in secret door! Will give this a go for kyj and once it gets disturbing I\\'m gonna stop. Waited so many years for her comeback and the casting is disappointing haters gonna hate hate hate.. does age really matter in korean dramas? there are so many pairing with big age gap.. why we just support every pairing they made.. besides it\\'s director sbd production\\'s choice.. they know it very well than us.. please just support your favorite actor/actress and not just criticized.. love love Now I can say nothing about this. Seriously I don\\'t know, I\\'m not happy since Ahn Yeo Seop droped and now their poor selection of male lead. Their still are good young actors waiting in line for their leading role and they perform really good. jisoo/minjae/sungjae/gongmyung/choi taejoon/lee hong bin, but still they would go for this type of pairing. -_- now can\\'t say anything more T.T and I\\'m disappointed for the selection of the lead male >,< yaya oppa accepted cant wait til November it has not been updated the filming starts in 10 june This will flop now that yoon gyun sang accepted! No one wants such an old guy next to Kim yoo jung! I hope it does so they can think twice about such stupid old to young pairings!!! Jisoo minjae sungjae jang ki yong lee hyun woo doohwan park jibin bogum any of these would do and they don\\'t have that big an age gap. Yet they ask a 31 year old to star in a drama opposite a 18 year old What\\'s that all about! Yook sung jae as main lead please. ji soo needs a lead role please i really liked the main lead role but why did he go and pick a drama that was a supporting role he read the script and everything. but please pick ji soo please chebal. i love yoon gyun sang but i am not sure of this like i love him in historical and detective but anyways i will look forward to it fighting now i have to wait till November I think yoon gyun-sang is too old for yoo jung. Please cast a much younger actor. Pleeeeeeeaaase. I want Nam joo hyuk because to me he looks like Ahn hyo seop. ^_^ please cast Nam joo hyuk or Yook sung jae. i think jung hae in would be better because hae in looks younger than him i really wanted to see ahn hyo seop with yoo jung:( I want Nam joo hyuk and Kim yoo jung together, and I\\'m really looking forward to this drama. ^_^ I forgot ONE (Jaewon). Please author cast one of them please. I beg you, please. I want a Chinese actor like Hu Yi Tian from A Love So Beautiful or Song Wei Long from Long For You or Wang Riley from Attention, Love! or Yang Yang. Even though there is an age gap between YooJung and GyunSang, I think it will be a good drama. Even if GyunSang isn\\'t taking the offer or does I\\'m still happy that YooJung is okay and continued the drama filming. No no no no and no! I think all fans will be disappointed. There are still many talented young actors like Nam joo hyuk, bogum, sungjae, jisoo, mijae and many others. No! All fans are disappointed.? he\\'s too old for her. Hays!? I wonder why they offer this to kyunsang as much as i like him i thought he doesnt fit the webtoon description, if only nam joohyuk is a good actors he\\'s gonna be perfect for this role but too bad he\\'s wooden Nooo not gyun sang! He\\'s too old for her! There\\'s so many younger actors who are available im sure! Jisoo minjae bogum sungjae Was so looking forward to that guy but since he chicken out, I want nam Joo hyuk with her then. Oh no!!! it seems I would not like it if my little girl paired with yoon gyun sang, because he is too grown for yoo jung. >,< Please cast anyone from Kim minjae/jisoo/choi taejoon/gong myung/yook sunjae/ lee hongbin if Ahn yeo seop drops out❤❤❤❤ Jin young!!! from love in the moonlight Yook SungJae would be perfect as the Male lead. BtoB Sungjae would be perfect as the Male lead. Choi Minho please Kim minjae please Nam Joo hyuk please!??? Park Bo-Gum or Nam Joo-hyuk please...:) Cast Bo Gum please?????? . Too bad Ahn Hyo Seop had to drop out. I like him too. So handsome and talented ❤️❤️ I want Nam joo hyuk ^_^ I am grateful for her health Kim Yoo Jung, but also disappointed because ahn hyo seop resigned. actually this year I rarely watch k-drama because waiting for this drama come ^ _ ^ well, whatever it is i will still support \"clean with passion for now\" because i\\'m await yoo jung action in her new drama. and for his successor hyo seop I hope his age is not much different from the female cast. >,< I\\'m so glad that we received good news that kim yoo jung\\'s condition is getting better & recovering well and they might start filming this August so it might air around October or November? but kinda disappointed that ahn hyo seop had to drop his role since they look visually cute together. thank goodness for the other cast who stay for this drama production & for yoojung, they are the real MVP ^^. I hope they cast the lead actor who is the same age range as my girl to avoid \"age issues\" as well as a good actor who can act & can create chemistry with yoojung & to the cast but I do have a feeling they might cast a rising new young actor but we\\'re lucky if they will cast a resident household name actor. I haven\\'t watched any kdrama for now because I am waiting for this lol all the best to kim yoo jung\\'s full recovery & to the crew & cast. Ahn hyo soep is not one of the cast any more because of scadual issue Go park bo gum hahaha Park Bo Gum is available!!! Please don’t drop Ahn Hyo Seop as the male lead pleaaase is yeo jin goo available? so they were waiting for the female lead Kim Yoo Jung to recovers her health but the male lead Ahn Hyo Seop had to drop out because of scheduling conflict. This drama can\\'t have both TT get well soon KYJ... we\\'re waiting for you ^_^ Omo, the comments!? Though I\\'ll wait for this kdrama, waah Kim Youjung~~ Please, wait for KYJ. Don\\'t replace her. Jebal! I want KYJ and Song Jae Rim. To; Kim You Jung Teary eyes when I read te articles about yoojungie.,,and really want to know the exact happening and also about cwpfn?? They are willing to wait for her because they have patients. Meaning they are in no hurry because they wanted her to play that part. JTBC has repsect for her because her health comes first. In the meantime they will support and care for Yoo Jung so she can recover. Thank you to all the staff, production team and co-stars who are will to wait until she recovers. I will be forever grateful to jbtc...it made me happy knowing that they will wait for yoojung until she is fully recovered.????????? I guess this drama will be move its release date. I\\'m glad that jtbc & cwpfn staff will wait for yoojung & will continue filming after she fully recovers, it really shows how they want yoojung to be in this after months of courting her, it seems yoojung positively embraced this project too. I really like how the prod. staff wishing her well & wants to see yoojung smiling again. I hope you all show support & encouragement to yoojung\\'s full recovery as well as to the staff for their patience & sincerity. to kim yoo jung, ahn hyo seop, song jae rim, the cast & cwpfn staff fighting! Can\\'t wait. Why is it so hard to wait??! Oh my god I can’t wait? My most anticipated drama this year! Kim YooJung saranghaeyo ❤️ #CleanWithPassionForNow casts and crew fighting. I\\'m looking forward to it... She’s one lucky daughter of God lol! Gonna watch this one I trust u yoo kung and I know u will do a good job. Fighting! @ the person falling jaerim\\'s fans \"so full of themselves\" like damn, im not a hardcore fan of any actor but your comment is quite hypocritcal? the name you chose says it all.... fans =/= actor oops, manhwa i mean⤵ Can April come faster so we can have this drama?:)) I really am excited for this and I\\'m glad that Kim Yoo Jung confirmed for it because I\\'ve been waiting for her to make a come back and this is her first young adult drama. She got several roles offered to her since last year but she chose this so I trust her decisions in choosing projects. When Ahn Hyo Seop announced that he is the leading man, I am quite satisfied because Yoojung and Hyoseop\\'s age range is not that far, it will be comfortable to imagine them on screen together, visually they are compatible with their webcomic characters & the height difference will be so cute. He is a rookie actor some are skeptical with him being the lead but I\\'ve read that he got tough competition & he was chosen so I trust that statement that they chose Hyoseop because he is worthy for the role and I hope we give him the chance. As for Song Jae Rim, netizens are critical abt the age gap between him & Yoojung if there will be a possible love triangle but his character is an original for the drama adaptation and I hope his character won\\'t be the cliche second lead type and hoping it has dynamics so that some won\\'t have any issues with it. Jaerim could accept other lead offered roles for him but he chose those, maybe he likes the script? he likes working with his possible cast? or likes working with the director & prod. staff, so who knows but him being offered for this role which means he is the only one capable of bringing it to the small screen. always support u,,, yoojung-ah fighting!!!! oh I cant wait anymore to see these three guys together.The cast is really amazing @ajhusshi jae rim thanks for the reminders,don\\'t worry we\\'re always here for our bbluvz yoojungie ..as long as may bbluvz don\\'t get hurt from jae rim fans,we will support and respect jae rim in any way... I hope its 18 eps.. Can\\'t wait for this! I hope it will have many episodes and not just 16 or less. Hehe Some of song jae rim fans are so full of themselves. If ahn hyo seop fits the main character what can you do? Plus song jae rim is so old T_T I hope he isn\\'t second lead, maybe a teacher or something, I just hope he stays away with Kim Yoo Jung or else I can\\'t watch it. I also remember how some of his fans bash his co-star kim so eun and claim she is only using him for popularity ha! Be careful of them kim yoo jung and ahm hyo seop fans. @ryan Kim Yoo Jung obviously is the very main lead here, not all of them.Yes she is young but she came from a phenomenal show and also an A lister teen actress as well. looking forward to it... ^_^ @Ryan. Hmm I don\\'t know cos it seems like his character was added to the drama just to make a love triangle. I really hope that\\'s not the case though, it would be so disappointing @eris yes, he will be the second lead but I think will be like the main male lead he will have a lot of screen time too. Actually the 3 of them is the main lead I think? this is such an insult to jae rim, why is he second lead??? he deserves to be in a drama as main role Song jae rim as second lead? Argghh we\\'re gonna have another second lead male syndrome!!! Can\\'t wait to see new drama of yoojung.. Very excited.. Fighting all of the cast!!! good luck for this drama^^ I hope to see a good chemistry between yoo jung and hyo seop... fighting yoo jung-ah!!! I like the casting its from pure actors not idols. I’m gonna watch this specially with yoo jung in it aaah finally confirmed! can\\'t wait to see kim yoojung acting again, it\\'s been more than a year. also curious to see how ahn hyoseop will do. Had waited Kim Yoo jung for soooooo long. I\\'m really excited for this drama. Good luck for the cast mas ketjeh?? #SongJaeRim i wish kim yoo jung and song je rim have a kissing scene. I wanna see how monster jae rim kiss kim yoo jung XD @casey IKR I feel like Jae rim will have more chemistry with Kim Yoo jung OMG This is complicated hahahahaha Can\\'t wait for this drama.. Fighting Kim yoo jung!!! Hoping success for this drama. They will regret for not choosing jae rim to be the main lead can\\'t wait to watch this drama, love kim yoo jung ^^ Awww... Its hongbin and namjoohyuk love child. YES. Bts v and kim yoo jung please. I want to see these two together in a drama. I think there is chemistry between them. Baby doll I\\'m so excited for this drama! Wishing this one all the best. Daebak ❤️ Awesomeness.... yayyyy... his first lead role!! Soooo much excited to seeee himmmm in his lead role... Daebakkkk!! #Chukahaemida omaiiii...i like both actor & actress.. by the way...the age gap between KYJ & AHS didnt that far.. its okay for me. AHS is 95\\'s while KYJ is 99\\'s....hiewww.. Cant wait... love you baby doll..❤❤❤❤..hoping for the success of your first adult drama,i know how hard it is for you to follow a drama after the huge success of moonlight.. no matter what will happen we will always proud of you baby doll..????? i hope ahn hyo seop will improve his acting, he is handsome I don\\'t know about the drama story line but I have to watch it for the leads... i really hope SJR declines this role because if AHS has already been confirmed, SJR would be the second-lead. Better for him to look for a better project as main lead i hope Ahn Hyo Seop is the main lead because Song Jae Rim is too old for her and kim yoojung deserve better then them There was a lot of people who criticized Saeron & Sohyun being paired up with guys 10+ years older than them. Lol even now, I\\'ve also seen people not liking Doojoon for Sohyun. Sheez people need to chill. Nothing\\'s wrong with it. The important thing is for them to work comfortably and do well with their acting and chemistry. Look, Saeron and YSY was cute together, Sohyun and Taecyeon was good too. Even other stars out there like Kim Go Eun & Gong Yoo and more did well with their chemistry too. It\\'s not like they will fall in love with each other. They will just act -_- Please complaining about the casting of SJR just because he\\'s a lot older than KYJ. If you don\\'t like it, then don\\'t watch the drama. And FYI, he\\'s a really great actor! Is it Ahn Hyo Seop or Song Jae Rim? @MIka why hate our jae rim gosh Ahn hyo seop and Kim Yoo Jung would make a great couple in this drama. They are only 4 years apart from each other. The girl is barely 18 and everyone is shipping her with male leads that are 7 to 14 years older than her. It is really disturbing. She looks like a child on top of that. Aren\\'t there young actors around her age? Finally our dear Yoo Jung.... Song Jae rim pls they have good chemistry! And he is a good kisser too! i want song jae rim male lead wow ahn hyo seop plz accept this as a male lead.. miss ur acting. love u oppa ❤ I hope they choose Ahn yo seop, Seo Kang joon, Kim Jung Hyun, or Kang Min Hyuk from cnblue or maybe Lee Hyun Woo. I hope it\\'s one of theses actors all of them will look great with her. Please except the role. Hope to see u in this drama Yoo Jungie. Can’t wait to watch it if u except the role. yoo jung noona accept this project please woo do hwan or jung hae in for male lead Can i get yang se jong for this I hope the rumour are true they said the male lead is yang se jong @Loop i think woo do hwan is most perfect pair to kim yoo jung Sungjae is good too but no to Nam joo hyuk he is a bad actor nam joo hyuk , infinite L, sungjae Yook Sung Jae can rock the chaebol role, or Do Kyung Soo. Ji Soo is also a good candidate, about time to give this boy a lead role. But then my first choice is still Sung Jae:P please kim yoojung comeback soon i really miss you Please Except yoojungie .... Miss you.... Who\\'s the lead male? Can\\'t wait hong jong hyun....he\\'s hoping to work with kim yoojung again..after them being the hosts at inkigayo back then.... Honestly... I really hope for Kim Yoo Jung to except! I really miss her on the screen! Yang se jong or Do kyung soo Park Bo Gum plss Yang se jong please Kim min kyu pls....surely good chemistry will overflow between them....plssssJTBC pick Kim min kyu.... Yook sung jae pls..or lee seo won.. Woo do hwan? Please for lead male ^^ fighting youjung... Always support you... D.o do kyung soo- park seo joon -yang se jong for male lead role pleaaaaaase Ohhh I think nam joo hyuk and her would be a great pair!!? hopefully she accept this drama:) my lovely baby doll Kim You-Jung:* @kendall park did you even read the webtoon? Because the webtoon specified thag the female lead is 19 years old which is Yoojung’s almost current age.If you haven’t read it, then who are you to say who fits and who doesn’t? If you read the webtoon you can almost imagine Kim Yoo Jung playing the girl even the picture looks like her. My point is check out the webtoon first before saying who fits and who doesnt, your comment is pointless I don\\'t care what drama or movies Kim Yoo-jung decided to do as long as I get to watch her. It\\'s all about my baby girl Kim Yoo-jung. I like kim you jung, i also want to see it coming back soon .. but i think kim you jung too young to become Gil O -sol character. Although his age is now an adult category. Originally, I thought the character of Gil O- Sol was suitable for Moon Chae Won or Lee Se Young (if the director or writer wanted a young actress). Moon chae won once played a messy and disheartening female character to herself, while Lee se young has never been but I think she will be very good for Gil O- sol character. This will be Lee se young second debut as the female lead in the drama.It\\'s still the search stage, i hope the director can choose carefully. Omg! Yeo Jin Goo or Seo Kang Joon please!!!! The guy needs to be manly type... I know the story is cliche but if Kim Yoo-jung is doing the drama I will support her. I think she will make the story better. I just hope the main actor is Got7 Jinyoung. I watch his video in Got7 and he looks like the type who likes to be clean and neat. i dont really like the story line tho, but if she accept it, then i know that the story is better than what i thought I know if it\\'s impossible, but.. i want to see V and her work together in a drama xD Yook Sung Jae, Seo Kang Joon, Ji Soo, Lee Won Geun, Do Kyung Soo, Yoo Seung Ho, any of these guys please!! We need a young but mature guy for the role Always support for you... Yoojungie fighting Yook sung Jae or oh seung hwan or ji soo please for male lead omg! Do kyung soo If it\\'s more about her then I hope she accepts! kim yoojung baby girl finally comeback i trust her chose in dramas i really miss her but the story not so good she id vrty great actress deserve better Let\\'s hope she doesn\\'t reject this one. can\\'t wait for your drama comeback baby girl Kim You-Jung',\n",

       "  'comments': 'What are the poems used here? Encounter is an inspiring drama about love between men and women, family and learn that we have to love ourself. I never see male character like this before. Bogum character is a rare thing in kdrama. The story is simple yet so heartfluttering and beautiful to look for. I like bogum hyekyo combo for me they are unique couple and one of very beautiful couple in kdramaland plus i love their acting. And i love the cinematography is really pretty. So encounter give us healing bcs of the story and the visual of the two mainleads. I just finished episode 5. It’s such a sweet drama. I thought I wouldn’t like it after hearing the negative reviews. The actors did really well. They were in perfect character. I can’t wait to finish the whole thing! Just finished watching Encounter.... Wow... Such a refreshing drama of the year.... Bo Gum rocks!!! Cuteness overloaded.... What a smile he has.... Totally fall for that magical smile.... Hye kyo, as usual did her best... Good story line... Nice screen play and all... Really love this drama.... Highly recommended... Don\\'t miss... The first episode thought me how most people in the world would like to have relationship with a humble person, you know, being kind while not expecting anything in return. The way the main leads giving help as generous gesture was something that remind me of how it feels to be a kind person like them. I wasn’t that interested to watch this drama at first but reading from the reviews I gave it a try. Well, the first few episodes intrigued me that is why I decided to finish watching it. Park Bo Gum oh my...has the face but portraying a 29 year old man seems like off as there are scenes that he acts like a teenager. Maybe it’s the character that he is portraying but I find it disappointing. Song Hye Kyo is really pretty but the acting I wasn’t that impressed. I think the story itself is too much with so many conflicts that is why it doesn’t seemed to be realistic. I also don’t think this kind of love exists. Not a fan of the drama but I still feel okay that I watched it satisfying my curiosity. SHK looks really like her real age in this drama. Maybe because she shows flat face almost for all scenes. That was really boring to watch, tbh. And she just like lift her eyebrows in trying to looks cold. To bo totally honest, I felt no chemistry between these two. I was kinda encouraging myself that I do like this drama, but the whole story was flat to me. What!? No intimate sex scenes? Not even implied sex? They are both at the prime of their life and have adult urges and needs! Not realistic at all. The guy is 30yrs old, but acts like he is 19 yrs old! Cmon! No wonder the CEO wanted to break up with him because of his juvinile attude, always in your face corny attitude and a cry boy momma\\'s boy! Perfect combination of two beautiful n sweet subjects..their smiles..hugs n kisses really adorable..watching this make me smile all the day and it\\'s healing I really love this drama. This is the only drama that made me happy all through out and never stressed me. The actors and actresses are all good and I love them all truly... Also, the OSTs are all really great! I love it! I like the acting of all the actors and actresses.. but i just don\\'t like the story. I don\\'t like that the female lead here in this story is so weak and easy to be shaken. And the male lead is not suitable to portrayed as a 29 years old guy while he is still that cute. Is there really exist this kind of love story in this world? I just literally finished the finale episode a minute ago and it wasn\\'t one of the best Korean dramas I have watched. But the story was so uplifting and it provided my soul with warmth and joy. I definitely learned so much, especially about what happiness and love truly means, and I know I will remember them for a very long time. The scenes had their own beautiful meanings even though they seemed like fillers only. The aesthetic is really pretty and overall, this drama is really beautiful. If you like melodramas, this is definitely a must-see. Complete waste of my time. Song Hye Kyo and Park Bo Gum has no chemistry at all. Their acting feels forced. Unlike other really good actors that you forget who they are when they\\'re acting because they really get into their character, here I never forget that it\\'s Song Hye Kyo and Park Bo Gum. That\\'s how awful it is. To be fair, I gave this drama a chance. I watched until episode 10. But did not get to finish it. Don\\'t want to waste any more of my time. There are a lot of better dramas out there. The cinematography in this drama was incredible. Every angle and shot had some sort of symbolic meaning and the colors and aesthetic was incredible. The shots made the drama so much more powerful and interesting to look at. The story, not so much. I\\'m not saying that the story was bad, and it could have gotten a lot more intense or intriguing (they could have done something with the story) but the drama kinda just ended all the conflicts without too much conflict. It was kind of looking at a beach and seeing this huge wave (the plot). The sunset makes the wave look gorgeous as it comes hurling towards the shore. However it doesn\\'t make a splash and kinda just disappears. It was like a diamond-coated cardboard; it is gorgeous and well made but the story itself is average. I honestly dont like this kind of story( older woman/younger man) What a beautiful drama. Tbh i\\'ve finished this drama 4 days ago but i feel like i need to take my appreciation speech to Asianwiki for some reason lol. To be frank i\\'m not a sucker for romantic dramas the way i was 5 years ago cuz since then i\\'ve been more into thriller-based dramas (i mean everyone knows just how so many thriller-based dramas have been taking up the kdrama world every year, almost like back to back) so i naturally have been drawn to watching dramas of such genre. The last time i tried to finish a romantic based drama was 4 years ago (Fated to Love You) but man how dissapointed was i at that time like either i chose a bad drama or simply cuz i was expecting too much. And then i, super curiously, saw the teasers for Encounter on TV. It was simple yet delicate in some way. I gave it a go and although it started off not all that great but i endured a bit more and by episode 4 i was finally hooked. Up until the end, this drama captivated me, heart and soul-esque lol. SHK\\'s performance had its nuance that only great actresses could potray and PBG was spectacular as everybody said (i was pretty sceptical when it comes to PBG\\'s acting but i feel like that\\'s just due to my not watching his acting closely). Overall it\\'s a romantic drama which tugged at your heartstrings and one that would make you fantasize of having such a perfect boyfriend like Kim Jin Hyeok lol. Job well done to the actors, director, production team and especially the screenwriter:-))) Absolutely to see. It is a drama that is good for the soul, refreshes it and comforts it, and is good for the mind, because it is sweet and relaxing. It is also good for the eyes, because the scenes are beautiful and the two main lead have a fantastic visual. The music, the dialogues, the sweet scenes of kisses and hugs, melt the heart. Then a word for the superb acting of Song Hye Kyo and Park Bo Gum: I knew how good she was, I did not expect to she act so well with my eyes, but I did not know him, but I\\'ll try to recover, because I think he\\'s the best actor of drama I\\'ve ever seen, a natural talent that enters the character\\'s skin and makes you feel his emotions. I thought there could be doubts about their chemistry, but it\\'s incredible. I give a nice 10 of rating. Very sweet and beautiful love story!!! It\\'s been a while since i got so hooked to a kdrama and i\\'ve watched 186 kdramas per se and this one is definitely one of those that i would rewatch... Why? It was so beautifully done.. The story yes is simple but the way it was narrated was so perfect.. Oh the acting of the two main leads of course make it more and more addicting especially park bo gum..sweet young boy who bravely love an ice lady... I just find this show perfect romantic kdrama.. Hats off to everyone!!! I’m so glad the writers resisted rushing through the story to placate some viewers who are impatient. This romance drama is a different take on the rich-poor, younger-older theme with the twist being the richer/older person is a woman. Of course, they are not going to act like wild young lovers because she is older, is the CEO and is divorced. So she is “experienced” but she has never really been in “love” before (she was previously in an arranged marriage). But even so, Song Hye Kyo and Park Bo Gum have great chemistry together. Hopefully, SJK won’t be too jealous. The Cuba scenes were nicely done and makes you want to visit. Well written (and acted) drama. Give it 10/10. We’ll worth watching again (I’ve already rewatched the last episode). For those who think they have no chemistry. But why they should show chemistry? CSH is like 6-7 years older than KJH. I say they protray their character well. Really Love PBG and SHK, Really Really Love everything in this movie???? \"Encounter\", honestly put me in a different mode every day since i\\'ve watched it. I remember my self carrying out \"so good and light mood\" at work after some episodes... what more noe that i\\'ve finish all 16 episodes.. (not to mention how many times i\\'ve repeated other episodes while waiting for 15 and 16). What a heartwearming love story, the actors portay the character well! It\\'s mature love story, and teach us to Love Yourself first! Then you can enjoy the love from other:)) This is love story. I like this story..?? the place in cuba is beautiful... I\\'m gonna miss u Song hye kyo and Park bo gum.. They are great acting.. God bless Just wanna say thank you TVN for bringing such a beautiful love story in a small screen.kudos to the producers,writers,directors and the whole staff.PBG and SHK and the rest of the cast great acting and i will be missing you. Beautiful story with perfect actors.Above all it was awesome. I would highly recommend this drama to watch. The story depicts the different kinds of love one can give - unselfish, sacrificial, knd, unwavering...... anyone can identify to each characters portrayed in the story. It’s a story about conquering the odds no matter what you are faced with - as long as you both hold on to each other and trust one another. a simple story yet i love it... both actors give justice to their roles shk and pbg are both great and amazing actors... another drama for them <3 and awards soon I\\'m so sad this drama ended.. it\\'s just so beautiful and heartwarming. Thank you for this drama and I really love it! I give 5 stars for this drama⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Gonna miss Park Bo Gum & Song Hye Kyo!!!? Love it all! Great ending as well!!! Absolutely mesmerizing. Perfect ending. SHK and PBG, great acting by both of you Wish it doesnt have to end. PBG, wish you are my son-in-law. Perfect ending. Perfect acting. Love the drama so much. Thank you for bringing to us such beautiful drama. Waaaaah! Just finished the drama. I want to cry and smile at the same time. It\\'ll take me at least a week to get over with this feeling. I will surely miss the story. Kuddos to everyone who helped and made the ENCOUNTER drama ended successfully. The story was simple yet the lesson will remain in my heart forever. Thank you PBG and SHK. A job well done to both of you and to the rest of the characters! Xoxo. A very satisfying ending. All ends well. A simple and less complication story which I find as my stress reliever..makes me cry and heart flutters at the same time . I also love all of it’s OST’s, very relaxing and romantic:):) What I like TVN drama Encounter at first is because I\\'m a fan of SHK. After watching the whole story Encounter. I like the drama more because of the professionalism of the actor and actress. They ALL act naturally, you will feel the situation they into, the character that they are portraying. 2 Thumbs UP for all the cast, director and writers. You better watch \"Encounter\". I highly recommend PBG and SHK to have award, they deserved it. Aw, now that’s an ending! Wish it didn’t have to end. Love this drama, even though it was a simple story, it did not bore me. Not even a single episode. Much better then Something in the rain drama where some ppl compare it to. That drama was a little boring and redundant with the whole love scenes, where this one developed and were great to watch. The chemistry between the two leads were amazing! Thank you for this drama! I don\\'t like it, Too Much Fairytale! Incredible cinematography and such a well written story. Every detail was just mesmerizing and breathtaking right from the beginning until the very end. Wow. I \\'m very happy now. Thank you SHK and PBG and others actors who showed to us the romatic drama. They were still in my mind. I will miss them so much.... i like both actors and the story line is good i just hope it doesn\\'t end up like with any fairy tale ending I live in New Zealand. I have absolutely fallen in love with a number of South Korean Drama series ... Whoa! .... Park Bo Gum is delicious. At 62 I dont have a problem relying on English Sub-titles (though most english speaking people do) ... Park Bo Gum\\'s acting ability; the range of emotions and multi talents are totally amazing. Lucky him that I am not 40 years younger lol .... If he ever finds his way to New Zealand, well he\\'s got a driver, place to stay, go fetch person - whatever ... best I go learn Korean .. Wow! Omg, seeing Jin-Hyeok cry like that makes me want to hold me and love him. How can anyone want to hurt him. He’s so adorable! I love park bogum after watching his previous drama..but in this drama i find his character so boring.i used to love him so much..i don\\'t know why he chose to do this drama.. Accidentally bumped into the first episode when it broadcasted in my country and got sucked in with each episode. At the beginning i found this drama quite boring..the leads didnt have chemistry at all. It was aukward to see them paired..but as the story went on...I can their ability as an high up actress and actor..the chemistry is getting stronger and the storyline is amazing..it really touching...cant wait to see how it ends..hopefully will be happy ending. I love everything about the drama- Encounter! I wait anxiously for each new episode to air. I am sad because there’s only two more episodes left I wish it was longer. Beautiful acting and I cannot get enough of Park Bo Gum he has a beautiful smile!?? am I the one who stop watching this drama after 5th episode? Actually I\\'m really excited to watch this because the actors and the actress. I was watching this drama and memories of alhambra. memories of alhambra made me more curious each episode and made me waiting no patiently. But this drama just made me left to finding new drama. I think the plot was bored and their chemistry I just don\\'t get it. But I love them I love everything about this drama. It makes me like a teenager, I feel giddy all the time. Park Bo Gum\\'s smile is always heart fluttering. I really love this drama. One of the best. It\\'s portrayal of pure, innocent love that will overcome (hopefully) all trials will give you warm feelings and will make your heart flutter. Everything about it is beautiful, Park Bogum and Song Hye Kyo\\'s acting are brilliant. Hoping for a happy ending!! I like it. Hope it has a good ending though Amazing drama. Those who find it boring either have no depth or are teenagers. Really this is my one of the osm drama I ever watch really nice both the actors do great job the main character lines are very good before this drama I really don\\'t like park bo gum but in this drama I really like him the way he is acting and as always song hye kyo is very very good actress and she is as always perfect in any drama and also she is very very lucky that she got very loving , caring , trusting & understanding husband In my opinion the only reason this drama has high rating is because the actor/actress are high profile....leads have no chemistry which makes it extremely boring overhyped drama to both overhyped actor/actress All i can say.... i forget that SJK is SHK husband when i watch this drama. SHK PBG chemistry are too great. First drama landing in my dream. Really landing in my dream when i took a nap. And when i woke up, i felt uneasy... One of the best kdramas of the past year! Little bit different with the rich-poor scenario (she is the CEO, he is a newbie employee). Beautiful scenery and the two leads have GREAT chemistry together. <<>> She is a bit “damaged” due to being “sold off” to further her father’s political career and dealing with “suffocating” in-laws. Her ex-husband had a fake affair to help her escape his family. He still loves her but she wants nothing to do with him and his family. She constantly worries about her BF (and his family) getting hurt from negative public scrutiny since he is just a “normal” person not accustomed to being in the public eye (people assume he seduced her and has it “made” now). Kind of a double standard since people wouldn’t be saying much if the roles were reversed. She has to “walk a thin line” between having a normal relationship and the boss/employee “land mines”. There are lots of outside forces that could derail their romance. She doesn’t care about the ex’s side, so whatever they say/do has no effect. But she desires acceptance from her BF’s family and worries how her romance will effect his family. So his family could be a problem. I’m predicting a happy ending with the couple in Cuba. Thank you for a well written drama. I love the dialogue between the main characters and the supporting characters are great too. Am throughly enjoying your writing as it is quite evident this is not the typical drama series. Your writing is like a beautiful landscape!!! I don\\'t care what other think about the drama I just love it soooo much. Everyone is doing a great job not only the lead actors/support actors but also director,script writer cameramen and everyone who involve in the drama production. The drama make my heart flutter its just some feeling that I want to feel again. Thank you so much for Tvn who produced this kind of drama,,,,,, I love SHK so much and I try to watch all her movies and dramas. However, I am very sorry to say this is the first drama I \"surrender\" and give up. The storyline is very boring and poor written, plus no chemistry between actor and actress. I hardly accept SHK loves the newbie PBG...How i wish SHK back to her ex-husband\\'s side, at least her ex-husband is romance, handsome and rich.. This drama capture everything perfectly. This is perfect for you if you want to feel another love feeling. This drama gives you a \"Mature love\" feeling. PBG and SHK chemistry just perfect. They excite not-so-close love feeling to each other since it\\'s a CEO and employee & noona - dongsaeng (SHK here is 35/36 and PBG is 29). But it\\'s cute to see PBG as a dongsaeng that have a normal life and i\\'m impressed how SHK express herself as someone that live a hard live. It\\'s just a perfect drama and perfect feeling if you\\'re really immersed in the story. Is it really that the release date for episode 15 & 16 is in 23rd dan 24th january?.... I love song hye kyo, never really watched park bo gum before but he is one young looking actor. Unfortunately I can’t feel any chemistry between them. I had to fast forward a lot when they appear together. I don’t know if it’s because SHK is now married or her previous drama still has my heart flutter when I remember her scenes with yoo se Jin. I’m still gonna watch til the ending but this drama isn’t of if my faves from SHK. The storyline is a bit boring. I’d rather watch how she’s gonna protect her CEO position than the romance with PBG. she bit her lips so much l almost turned gay...she is sexy as hell I don’t care whatever other people think, I’m soooo in love with this drama and it’s very exciting that makes my heart flutters. Lead actors/ loveteam were doing a great job with their roles. 100% for me! ok just watch ep.13 and the main romance was clear sailing with only small bumps with her ex-in-laws....so something had to give way for this romance to hit a brick wall...and of course it had to be KJH\\'s side!! but what gets me is the reason behind it...and its the same reason with every other romance, family cannot take the out side pressure of this romance going any further....and of course this decision going to reverse itself due to selfishness of the family (mainly the mother) but until it does, the opportunity for the ex-husband just opened up...and theres your typical kdrama romance doing the same boring full 360...of course true love will reunite them once again to end off on a happy ending!!!...im watching this cause how cute and romantic the story has unfolded so far and the side story\\'s are boring too!! I hope KSH will be back to her husband, JWS. A very good drama, in my opinion, because this drama offers an unusual story plot, where a man from an ordinary family falls in love with a woman from the upper class, usually a story that is common in Korean dramas, which are from ordinary or poor families are female characters, song Hye Kyo and Park Bo Gum have done a good job, if anyone says acting songs Hye Kyo and Park Bo Gum Awkward and lack of chemistry I have a reasonable explanation, of course from my point of view. In my point of view, I like SHK and PBG acting together. Usually i will cry watching korean drama especially when SHK is the main lead. However, it doesnt makes me feel like crying. I think the plot is not interesting. Some sort less emotional touch and mayb cutting the scene too short. I dont know but all i can say is the story line is “thumbsdown”. WHat happen? For me, i enjoy this drama.. yes i got bothered because hye kyo status as joongki’s wife ekek but i think this drama so good, i get lots of lesson from there, i love aoo hyun and jin hyuk but i think it will be more fun if soo hyun got confused between jin hyuk and woo seok, i want woo seok show his love to soo hyun too and the ending, soo hyun will be back to woo seok ekekek but i still love this drama:) I wasn\\'t impressed with ep.1. Here are some main reasons, although I feel it\\'s more of the fault of the director, casting director & script writer rather than the leading cast: I stopped watching at episode 6. It\\'s boring, I should say. The plot is predictable and the sweetness is forced in the script. I also find some awkwardness in pbg and shk acting. Not natural and they lack chemistry. Can\\'t fool myself anymore. They don\\'t make my heart flutter. So sad because i like pbg so much since i\\'ve seen him in love in the moonlight and reply 1988. So excited and i fell inloved with the story.. keep on doing great episodes... Im an avid fan of Park Bogum here in the Phils. I never had interest in kpop or kdrama before.but when ive seen the trailer of Live in the moonlight,i was enchanted by the eyes of PBG.then i started to try watching the first episode and boooom!i was hooked by the lines,characters,OST,the story and of course the great acting skills of PHB.i didnt even sleep at night and failled to attend classes because i wanted to finish the drama. From then on,i started to follow him on twitter and instagram and viewed diffrent ads,video coips,ost and read different articles of PBG. I even downloaded video clips,movies,photos,commercials, and other kdrama that he is in. I was like experiencing what is fan girling all about. For the past two years i had been anticipating and getting excited about his comeback in small screen. At first i had a little worry about his tandem with song hye kyo. I had seen her in DOTS and shes really a good actress but i was diubting about their chemistry and the audience reaction. But when i had seen the first 5 mins of the drama, all those worries faded away and then again that same feeling of excitement,giggle, and happiness and magic i had felt in LITM came back. I really loved this drama. I had seen more than 50kdramas and this is my TOP 2. Top 1 of course is the LITM. There are four more episodes and im looking forward for some twists in the story and a more intense scenes but i feel sad a little coz once this ended i will be missing bogum again. You know just cant help to smile when he does and cant help to fall in love when he gazes. So i wish that this drama will be extended even up to two more episode. God hear pls my prayers. I am die hard fan of SHK and I am watching Park Bo-gum for the first time and oh god I am crazy about him now.All have done fabulous job and everything is going perfect love watching this show. I did not watch the \"descendants of the sun\" because for some reason I never got over Song Hye Kyo and Jo In Sung. And honestly I never liked Jong Ki and I know big time he don\\'t care.?But the moment I watched Encounters trailer, bam! I knew I will love it. And I did, I do, and I will for until I\\'m breathing I guess. So that\\'s it. All i\\'m saying is daebak! It\\'s really amazing in many different ways. I just wish the rating depends on me then both hye kyo and bogummy will get what they really deserve. Damn i\\'ll bring justice and give it a 101%! And to those who says they don\\'t have chemistry? Ahm duh? You must be really cold hearted because hey I would have been melted since December last year. There chemistry is beyond just chemistry. I would grin from ear to ear and I never knew my laughter could be a music to my own ear, and then you\\'ll feel there sadness. That melancholy they mention so many times. And then you feel the warmth. I think that\\'s the best part of it. They portray their role so perfectly I think they should be together for real. Which I know will never happen but. . Just but. Does anyone know what is the song name sang by PBG over the phone? Previously, I was blind for any Korean Drama. Only hear from the news and friends\\' comments. I was too busy with work apparently. But since I have a flexible time in my life now, I commited to watch this drama when I knew it was advertised in one of Indonesian TV channels. It has been aired in a week (5 days/5 episodes) and to be continued next week. I wanted to give this drama a try since I was fans of Song Hye-Kyo & Park Bo-Gum. However, this drama was a big disappointment. SHK and PBG don\\'t have any chemistry together. I don\\'t think these roles were suitable for them. Anyhow, their love line in the drama is very boring. There is something wrong or missing when the majority of viewers wants the main actress with the second male lead. I lost interested and stopped watching. I think she should get back with her ex husband even though he is not the male lead. He was weak during their marriage but he now knows how to sacrifice for love. The love relationship between Jyn Hyeok and Cha Soo Hyn seems strained, very unnatural. I think if they gottogether they would become bored. Cha Soo Hyn does not even know her husband did not cheat on her but helped her escsped his scary mother. She and her ex should give it another try. They should strike out on their own away from both sets of parental control. Jyn Hyeok should get tother with his friend who is in love with him. His family will be happier and more comfortable. I love this drama so so much...I voted SHK and PBG 100%. they are full chemistry. This is my first time saw drama, and i enjoy it. I love to see their chemistry i hope this drama have a good ending if not thats will break my heart and my mind Just another drama about conglomerate families controlling their chaebol kids and middle class families using their daughters for social success and prestige. I love everything about this drama. The characters (especially Song Hye Kyo and Park Bo Gum), the acting, the storyline, the scenery, etc. This time, the woman (Song Hye Kyo) is the boss and the man (Park Bo Gum) is the employee. Even though he is the employee, PBG pursues, but not aggressively, SHK. SHK is lonely after a failed marriage and a life that up till now has been decided by others (parents, in-laws). She is the CEO but decides to open up to this younger man she met in Cuba. She also decides she wants to live her own life and rebels against the people who still want to control her. Highly recommend this drama. The hour goes by so fast while watching each episode and then have to wait a week for the next set of episodes. Only 6 more episodes. The drama is reaching it’s climax. How will SHK and PBG overcome their struggles and will they get married at the conclusion? Can’t wait to find out. I give this drama 5 stars. I love this drama. I think the storyline are great despite some negative comments about it. I love watching the main character falling in love every week and the way they overcome hardship like an adult. Also that it is not a fairytale kind of story but more of a realistic kind of storyline which makes it so addictive to watch. And both bogum and hyekyo are great too, too great that i have forgetten about joongki and their relationship with each other in real life. I wish the ratings are higher though. =( Song Hye-Kyo and Park Bo-Gum are two very talented actors and among the most popular ones as well. This drama shows that age does not matter when it comes to love. It shows how a man should treat his love. His nice loving family... I like Park Bo Gum since Reply 1988 and I have been a fan of Song Hye Kyo since Full House. I want to like this drama but I’m not sure about the pairing.. its like watching a romance between a nephew and his aunt. I’ve seen few dramas with noona dongsaeng romance and I like them.. Cha Soo Yoon was meant to be potrayed as matured woman but she looked like older woman instead.. their romance also has escalated quickly that I’m sure what to expect for the rest of 6 more episodes. Is it just me or the storyline is getting dull and predictable. It\\'s so sad, the storyline is so boring. I love SHK and PBG. But for this drama, i cannt continue to watch this. I stopped in ep 6. T_T Hello, Watching the drama making me remember again the feel of first time in love. Hi. I am so in love with this show. I relate to Kim Jin-Hyeok a lot. I think people see him as a very free spirited, happy-go-lucky person. However, every move he makes is with purpose and direction. I think the reason he doesn\\'t talk much about himself or his goals is because he tries his best to takes things one at a time, and he enjoys the moment a lot. The books he read and the movies he watch are so similar to the books I read and the movies I watch. I admire how thoughtful he is and what he is willing to do for his partner. Hope to see him succeed with Ms Cha. Would love to see that. I feel a personal connection to this show. Wonder if there will be more seasons. This drama tell us how the love that is so pure, classic and magical develops. Love the story so much. All the actors are great. OST are all great. Waiting for the next episode. Love story on its purity, done with class and sincerity. Love both the lead actors they are great. Love the scenery and its poetic values and lessons in love. Love all the OST. After the Goblin OST this is now on my list. I hope they can write and produce more love stories like this which is classical and millenial at the same time. Congratulations to the writer, director and all actors. Job well done. Waiting for the next episode.:) Boring, they only used the actors name to boost this drama, but the actors\\'s chemistry are awkward n not natural. Dissapointed tho The story is very boring.. really.. fairytale story is boring... Song hye kyo and park boo gum like noona and dongseng... Song Hye Kyo and Park Bo Gum is very good actor/s. Every episode is worth the wait?????. So sad that the ratings of this drama decreased. Song Hye Kyo is my fave Korean actress but the story is too dull. Will continue to watch it until the last episode though. Agree. It got a bit boring and dull. There really no other ways this story can go around. It will only have one predictable ending. The rating even decreased consistently now. Quite disappointing for a drama with A-list actor and actresses. I blame the lack of powerful plot. On the bright side you still can enjoy the visual. I love this drama! Everything in it!!! It\\'s just so wonderful, heart-warming, beautiful! SHK, PBG, Direktor, Writer are doing a great job! I\\'m so thankful for Encounter! I like this drama at first.. but then it got realllllly boring like, okay, so? Couldnt believe its ep 10 already when i dont think many things happened. Yes I will watch till the end for the sake of I must finish what i am starting but now i am starting to hope this ends soon. Highly anticipated but disappointing in very episode, should hv focus on the story rather than kisses.... Song hye kayo and park bo gum wow very passionate kiss until now I can\\'t move on so love this drama a lot this could have been a nice drama if something would actually happen. but nothing ever does. ENCOUNTER I, loved this romantic drama ever. Im beloved fans of Songsong couple and also Park Bo Gum. How many times I repeating on watching this drama every single episode while waiting for the next airing episode. I got a copy to give my friend to watch it too. I love the fierce and chemical reaction between Song Hye Kyo and Park Bo Gum.I give you a higher score to your ratings.? This is my first time to comments here.\\ufeff??? Cast is good. But the story is very boring. I think some of the kissing scenes at the end of ep 10 was taken with her husband. The shot at the balcony was far enough to disguise that it was Park Bo-Gum...the kiss scene at the balcony was intense compared at the scene where taken outside the park with Park Bo-Gum. Did not expect the long kissing scene from song hye kyo..quite suprise..i never saw any acting with those passionate kissing from song hye kyo.. This is such a heartwarming drama. I feel so relaxed when I watch this.:-) That kiss was awkward. I don’t blame them, she’s the wife of his closest friend. She’s been married for only a year so being intimate in a drama is totally understandable yet doable. Give her five years and she’ll be fine...I hope so or else it’ll be a waste of a great talent. I didn’t expect they’ll have that good chemistry and charisma together??Can’t wait for next episodes? I’m so glad I gave this a chance. I haven’t been this excited since Live up to your name. The two main actors have such great chemistry. JH is so sweet & pure, and Cha is strong & innocent. I love it when they’re in their love phase. Love the story. Simple but not boring. Can’t wait till the next episode. Wish it was more: D This drama is so heartwarming I just wachted episode 10. SHK and PBG were so great day by day. They loved and worked by their warm hearts. I have to wait next week to meet them again. it\\'s so long time.... I don\\'t know but i adore more relationship between Cha Soo Hyun and her Ex husband?? This drama is supurb. I feel like I\\'m on my teenage life again. I love this drama. The kisses in episode 8 surprised and touched me, especially the facial expression and emotion of PBG. The pure and strong chemistry between them made me fall in love again and I\\'ve totally forgotten about joong ki oppa. I\\'ve watched this drama many times and can\\'t wait to watch episode 9&10. Never in my whole year of existence have I watched a Kdrama so good and so pure. Happy to see that the female lead is a strong, independent woman and she is the rich and influential one and not the male lead. You canot see many KDramas with that plot. The acting of the actors is great and the cinematography in episode 1 is Awesome. It is like watching a movie and makes you want to go to Cuba. I am so attached with the character of Song Hye Kyo. I can feel her pain being lonely, being mistreated and being used. She just want to be happy and have wings that can make her fly out of her lonely cell. So sad I have to wait for the new year to watch episode 9 and 10. from the first episode till the 8,i have been enjoying and always having thrilled to watched that series,i love very much Park Bu Gom and Song Hye Kyo,i feel my heart gonna explode because the chemistry of them.I wish they gonna win the 2019 award:-)i really love how the story going and how interesting farthermore. After 8 episodes, I feel that the chemistry of these two talented people is falling short. It’s really interesting, because PBG by himself has amazing chemistry with his other leading ladies, ditto Song Hye Kyo, Either they can’t get past the age barrier, or being close friend and wife of Song Jong Ki. Or maybe they can\\'t convince the viewer like me that they\\'re crazy for each other. I kept thinking if PBG is paired with someone like the noona in She Was Pretty or Secretary Kim, and Song Hye Kyo is paired with someone young, fun and irreverent like Park Hyung Sik (who sassed the normally serious Park Bo Young endlessly in Strong Woman Do Bong Soon), this drama would’ve worked. I like PBG and SHK, but they act more like friends than lovers in this drama. I love this drama . Both lead act natural ... love their chemistry . And the romantic kisses Hate to say it but this is a sad ending. Why? Cause it\\'s a good unrealistic drama. I feel pity for Woo seok.. he has an unrequted love, his love for Soo hyun is pure though. This story of this drama is very interesting i enjoy watchibg this? Male lead and female lead look uncomfortable around each other, despite the storyline, it’s like he is addressing his mother nothing leaning romantically to either party, maybe after 12 episodes they might develop chemistry but at the moment it’s too clinical, kind of stand offish. The boy looks more uncomfortable than the female lead. can\\'t wait next eps. Woo! they are back in Cuba? I\\'m in love with this drama,the actors really fits to their roles and Hye kyo and Bogum doing justice to their character. I rate this drama a10... Since this drama has a top trending, so i decided to watch this after took a long break for K dramas. And i fall in love with this drama, even though it\\'s a little bit weird.. this likes a cinderela story for man version?? I\\'m so inlove with this drama. Both actors are doing great especially Park Bo Gum. At first, I thought the series would be a bit awkward because of the age gap between SHK and PGB.. But they really nailed it! They are both perfect for the characters! Loved episode 8 so much.it made me to fall in love again! Love this drama.an old school of expressing love daebak! Wow, the ratings are so high for cable tv. I love the lead actors and I am a fan but still I don\\'t want them together til the end. I want Soo Hyun with her ex husband. Anyway he is really in love with her. I don\\'t know but ep 8 makes me uncomfortable.. Still rooting for Woo Seok and Soo Hyun... I reaally hope they will end up together. Love this movie..very touching. Good idea.....well done! Encounter is really beautiful, it gets my feet off the ground. I love how SHK & PBG delivered their roles. KUDOS for you guys. Keep up the good work. this drama is exceptionally and outstanding. I give this drama a rating of 10 and above. I am melt now, Go for it PBG! I\\'ve really enjoyed (Encounter) and love so much both of u ( SHK and PBG) I don\\'t like the plot of story, not very special and too much boring scene, its just like of you watching first episode and than u don\\'t curious what happened on next episode. This drama only got high rating because of the cast i guess it. Being a song song couple fan i never expected that I’m going to love this drama , although SHK never failed me in every drama that she made. They’re doing a good a job and really oozing with chemistry which makes me very excited to wait for the next episodes . At first I felt a slight awkwardness but it slowly dissipated because there were very beautiful subtle dialogues and scenes that smoothly transitioned to more fast paced and exciting episodes! I would speak louder trying to prod Jin-Hyeok to go hold her, embrace her or kiss her already! At times it seem so frustrating because of those hesitation on screen! Finally you gave us that embrace and that kiss! So I must wait for 2 weeks for the next episode...ugh:( it always happened with park bo gum\\'s drama. I still remember how desperate waiting for reply 1988 next episode caused of new year pbg should be matched with young female star. sickening to watch close contact scenes with older woman..................have some mercy. try tweaking the story for each to have other loves. owhhh those nosy Chairwoman Kim and Mr Choi. Whats wrong with them falling in love. I understand how desperate Soo Hyun wants to get away from her ex MIL. Even i can\\'t stand that lady. it\\'s a good thibg Soo Hyun met Jin Hyuk.. Stay strong Jin Hyuksshi.. Fight for your love!!!! @Kepvil Saltnpaper - Take Me Into Your Arms Boring gives me the creeps to see bogum hugging and kissing hye ko - yuks - such a bad and sick match. pbg\\'s charms are wasted - hye ko is so cold looking. shudder to see drama - alaways skip deliberately. worst of the worst of the worst drama ever produced. Nice drama....perfect couple??? Today is Wednesday, my most awaited day for Encounter episode 7. It\\'s my happy Encounter night. I will be enjoying watching before going to bed. hehehehe Lovely story and I like the episode 6 the most. PBG and SHK are really acting well. Anyone knows the title and artist of the english song that plays? Nice story. Perfect cast. Acting is superb. Both PBG and SHK performed well. By just looking into their eyes even without a words you can feel the sincerity and love. They have done it with class and style. There is chemistry with the main actors. Congratulations to the writter, director and the whole cast. Great work. Waiting for the next episode. for those who asked the title of the songs.. I love episode 6. SHK and PBG took care together so cute. I watched them many times. I really wait for next episode 7, 8. I\\'m falling in love again, this drama is such a wonderful and giving me a chance,, PBG and SHK are great actors love by the viewers.Bravo!!! this drama gives me the \\'Notting Hill\\' feeling and it feels so good... Does anyone know the background song title in episode 2 (ramen date in rest area), episode 3 (playing sand date in sokcho), and episode 6 (after cake date)? they\\'re all the same song Its gonna be a long wait again. Can you please show them all!! Song Hye Kyo and Park Bo Gum you are doing a good job. SHK i watch all her drama and she never disappoint me. She is getting better and better Anyone knows what\\'s the title of the english acoustic song in episode 5 22:40? The song was played in episode 4 too but by a female singer. B.O.R.I.N.G 6 episodes in a row!!! In one night! It happen again to me after several years , skip bed time for Kdrama... while waiting 7th ep, I am gona reply it again and again. Gosh, really love this drama. it is so sweet, sometimes you dont needs word just with each other eye contact. it\\'s enough. rooting for soo hyeon and jinhyeok. may happily evet aftet. IDK if I should start watching it again. I mean, does it get better?I watched ep 1 and thought it was so boring!! If you liked the first episode, please don\\'t reply to me, but if there is someone out there who didn\\'t care for it but as they went on started to enjoy it, please let me know if I should continue. Thanks Woo, it is going to be a long wait for episode 7 & 8, Wednesday & Thursday please come!!!! Can we skip Friday through Tuesday and just make it Wednesday and Thursday everyday? its too great for only 10% rating in Seoul. So under rated. could you see Hye Kyo or Bo Gum smile? in every episode they give a surprise that you can feel the butterflies in your tummy. Show me the way erase my last comment... ughhh... after finished episode 2, I regret telling you this is a boring drama. Cincha!! This drama so classy , genuine, and bring us to roller coaster emotion. Bogum acting skill really amazing. The story so classy and different. Daebak Whoaaaah,whoaaa this drama is driving me crazy!Lot of comments stating\" I get butterlies in my stomach\" is no joke.It\\'s been a long time since I feel butterflies in my stomach by watching a kdrama.I never thought park bo gum and song hye kyo would click as a loveteam! But my....What an endearing love story,simple yet so sweet,not cheesy!And the ost...! argh my heart!Wed come quicky! Pali,pali! Pfffff so boring drama I really like park bo gum. The way he convert the feeling in drama so sincere. He never let down everyone Really love\\'it this drama, i\\'m cry... but perfect. Thanks so mauch, it\\'s wonderfull drama. Why bogum smile often? I expect him so high. And really missed him in drama. I kept this drama till episode ended so it won\\'t turtore me like his dramas before. But I can\\'t stabd watch him so I started watch it. But Wt*, 1st episode...so boring.... I stopped it. One day I gonna watch it I love this kdrama??I always wait for next episodes.Everything is so good✌? about it. I like acting of both main actors?. One of the good #Romantic_Kdrama_of2018_MustWatchIt? Episode 5 & 6 were so good! Thank you.... to those who haven\\'t watched this drama. Do it, it is highly recommended. It\\'s worth it. The best drama I\\'ve seen since 2017 to the present. Honestly, I also wanted to stop watching it after the 1st week. I felt like SHK was repeating characters and PBG didn\\'t really have a good chemistry with her but I kept watching and I am glad I did. The chemistry is definitely building and the story is interesting in how it\\'s playing out. It\\'s a slow build but pleasant. I don’t know why I found that this drama getting bored and no interesting scence. Too slow and lack of idea drama so far. I was watching this drama from 1-2 and skip to 6 episode only. I won’t watch to next episode again. The next day I watching Clean With Passion drama & The Last Empress drama without skip not even 1 episode! Seriously, I think im gonna stick with this two Kdrama only at the moment which is so far much better and great from this Encounter drama! Plot Drama C Class . enough watch 2 episode .:( I Dont care what people say... “its not good etc,,” for me is very wonderful. They have great chemistry whenever i keep watching this i keep smiling and feel Young hahaha... take note.... i Dont understand Korea... but i keep watching Raw until the SUb came out.. the truth is 3 to 4 times i watched the drama... im so addicted to them... Im waiting for the KISS why is still not happening.. P.S... I hope its wednesday again... good Luck every one... Stopped it on episode 2, all i see is Song Hye Kyo and Park Bo Gum , nothing more. The story and plot is very monotonous and so predictable, we almost know what the actors are going to say ,, personally I am disappointed, very disappointed really refreshing how humble and conservative the main actor is portrays, main actress plays her character as a fierce warrior with a caring heart yet hardening with her conglomerate in laws. But like alot of kdrama\\'s the humble tries to hard to be nice and over caring too much that it becomes annoying. Why cant they both agree to be just good friends and let love blossom in time and if it was meant to be it will happen slowly...he starting to over do it that its starting to look like stalking...anyways i hope theres a twist to this drama cause i dont want another in-out-in-out relationship with a triangle in the midst and in-law revenge mixed in. Unrealistic storyline If you are hesitating on watching this drama, I would say give it a shot. Its worth it. The first episode drew me in, I could tell its going to be one of my favorites. Very refreshing and lighthearted. SHK\\'s emotions on this drama is well performed/excellent! I love her eyes expressions, everything she does on this drama is excellent, she is like acting in real life and I\\'m with her every moves she makes! I was initially really interested in this drama because of the cast but my korean friend recommended me not to watch this drama so i was like?? But seeing as the comments and reviews are good on this site ill give it a try and see how it goes! 1st episode is very romantic and full of mysterious ways of encounter. Of the 2 character. Its like you were there too as if you were suddenly run into them. Well portray of Havana Cuba like a place of lovebirds...the dancing(salsa) sunset, the streets, the immigration, coffee shop so vintage style i can say...? Park Bo Gum is doing great here.,his looks,emotions,and acting is really great. He is a match with Song Hye Kyo, my heart is happy watching this drama. This drama is definitely one of my favorites .. Episode 1 being in Cube.. it\\'s just so unique and the visuals are so breathtaking Rather than her hair style, SHK Looks older than usual. I love this drama. Reminds me alot with devilish joy. But in sweet way. I watch all 4 episodes. They both acted perfect. I realy enjoyed of every moments in this serial and now im waiting for the next episodes?? Honestly when i first started watching this i kinda tried to plan it out how it might go after each episode since i did that with many other dramas and it did go how i expected, since most dramas have the same kinda plot. But im really happy cuz nothing goes how i expected. Its also new and quite realistic showing how cruel korean society can be, as they can be quick to slander and nitpick people in the high society (is that whats its called) Hey I don\\'t feel anything after watching this drama. No chemistry I have palpitations in ep 4 ending!!! Bogums love is pure and innocent, and his smile is life!! Song Hye Kyo nailed it as always! New and unpredictable drama thats why i\\' m loving it! It\\'s a nice idea that Song Hye Kyo and Park Bo Gum were teamed up for this drama. When I first saw the trailer I was amazed and I knew this drama is worth to watch and I was right. Every time I watched this, it really touches my heart maybe because I can relate. This drama is a treasure. I hope it will be happy ending. Also hoping that Song Hye Kyo and Park Bo Gum could team up again for a new project. Aww! episode 4 is heartbreaking! Loving it!!! My famy love this drama so much,cant wait for Wednesday and Thursday for ep 5 & 6. Song Hye Kyo and Park Bo Gum are great actors the teasers are misleading. Is it just me who felt bad for soo Hyuns ex husband he’s trying to protect her and has feelings for her Good drama one that relates well to the audience you could feel like you are one of the people in the story i can feel the mood of the scene because Song Hye Kyo and Park Bo Gum act their role with confidence their expressions and gestures is believable!!! love it!!! cant wait the next episode!!! I really love how the storyline goes on. Even though the male lead is young but he is really protective over his ladylove. Eay to go jinhyeok and soo hyeon. I\\'m shipping both of you. The director is brilliant! Very well directed. Then I looked at the dramas that he has directed before, there\\'s Hyde Jekyll Me, where almost all of the scenes were perfect. Of course, both the lead actors are brilliant too. I dont know why, many peoples questioning about the plot. Whats the title song like \"Oh take me on into you arms I’ll go wherever world you’re on\"??? Episode 4 is so Beautiful... It is so amazing to see both of the main characters are excellent conveying their emotions. Love it so much! Best Anybody know the title of this song? wow have chills for episode 4. great drama! amazing chemistry! better than i could have expected. I\\'m loving episode 3, PBG missed SHK....that\\'s why he came!? Woot! Woot! I\\'m an old woman, but still my heart flutters....watching both of them making eyes to eyes. hehehehehe Bogum\\'s charisma strikes again!? It\\'s good to see Hye Kyo again after her wedding with Bogum\\'s chingu??? First of all I love me some PBG?. Secondly, I\\'m not ready. My heart is literally racing! There are so many thoughts going through my head with this couple. I hope that the storyline doesn\\'t run the same course as other dramas that involve the rich and powerful and those that are just ordinary people living from day to day; who are literally torn apart and made to feel like they are invisible and meaningless. I can\\'t wait anymore, please show them all. Good script, nice story. Unique! i can\\'t wait SHK \\' l love her soo much I never see any drama with PBG..but i like SHK so much..after saw this drama..PBG seems so natural and the drunk scene is very cute.. Good Drama. Nice chemistry, but please make SHK\\'s hair long. Short hair makes him a mom to their chemistry lol Amazing chemistry bogum and hye kyo. Im smiling and my heart fluttered. This drama touch in my heart. I will watching this series until the end. I\\'m hoping and praying that this doesn\\'t become a snoozefest given that PBG goes for the tender-soft-slightly passive type roles and I don\\'t see SHK being the aggro one in this relationship either. I just want some SPICE This drama is addicting!!! I almost forgot that Songhyekyo is already married in real life...their chemistry is undeniable!!! What\\'s the title of the soundtrack? The one with the lyrics \"you\\'re my flower and i am the bee...\"? Smiling while watching. Love them both. I feel calming watched the series..: This drama is soooo good. Am really loving it. I don\\'t care if SHK is older than PBG.. They look good in this drama and the story fits them well.. Can\\'t wait for the next episode... Two of my favorites actors/actress in one show is very overwhelming!!! Daebak!!! I feel like I\\'m gonna die from heart flutters.???I already watched the first two episodes and I\\'m already hooked by it!! And now I am looking forward to the upcoming episodes!!! Park Bo Gum looks really adorable in this role and Song Hye Kyo never fails to amaze me in every role she takes. I so love their chemistry despite their age gap and actual relationship in real life!!! Congrats to TVN,actors,actress and staff this drama will surely be a big hit!!! Saranghe!!! This is really good and cute. Well it\\'s TVN guys! i dont get it why 2 different status relationships (poor and rich) is immensely popular in korea. this is a similar genre as my golden life (which was also a hit). i keep imagine jung woo seok character as song joong ki. actings are undeniably flawless The chemistry between the two of them is good.. Can\\'t wait till the next episode.. I hope the story would be interesting as the cast and unpredictable. They look cute together even with a big age gap. Fab actress and actor. I finally got to watch the first 2 episodes and I can tell this is going to be a real hit TT it\\'s become such a good drama already that I can\\'t wait for the next episode. Korea really did finally decide to reverse roles in drama and stop making cliche dramas with rich male lead and poor female leads:))) PBG is so adorable I kept on giggling to myself the entire time he was acting drunk on the 2nd episode XD Ilove the chemistry... ❤ I think her EX husband still love her. I never seen PBG acting..but i like SHK very much..but after saw PBG..he looks natural n the drunk scene is so kawaii... No wonder how the rating goes up....first the cast its a grandslam actor and actress.Hyko is always top noched when it comes to drama.... Besides of her super duoer cutie face....Bogum your always gorgeous and more handsome how come you are a gifted talented actor..Two versatile actor/actress together in a drama series......grandslam same with the Dots....... First two episodes has been released and it already fed me with so much emotions! Their chemistry is daebak! This is a very fluttering show. Both of them are really good depicting at thier role..Thumps up Initially i hv reservation abt this show. But after watching epi 1 and 2, I am won over. I looking forward to the next epi. It\\'s been sooooo loooooooooong time since i have butterflies in my stomach. lmao. This is good, nope, way too good. Their chemistry and acting are so good. I\\'m even forgetting SHK is married to SJK lmao. I shipped them since day one, CSH & KJH hwaiting!!! Waiting for next week feels like a year now. episode so cute.. ahh how can PBG be that perfect. so handsome T.T at first, because of their actual relationship, i thought it is gonna strange but then i remembered i watched NCIS Los Angeles and kensi and deeks (lovers in the series) were in reality sister and brother in law so... It is their job even though they are somehow related and i think it is a bigger challange because of this. I Loved Loved Looooved Episode one!? It look me 15 mins to fall in love with the drama & I started squealing when Bo Gum came on screen (which I never do). Last time I was this obsessed with a drama was when DOTS came out. Is it because I like Song Hye Kyo or is it because this woman always chooses amazing dramas? I’ll never know. I give encounter a 300/10. To the contrary of all the negative comments. I find these two have a very fascinating & fluttering feelings every time they encountered on the 1st episode. The 1st episode loved it! a torturing wait for the 2nd episode and so on...Huh! A couple that has a lot of challenges to go through danggg. really love this drama, waiting episode 2 and 3 From watching first episode, I assume this will be more of romantic fantasy genre..,, lovely to watch and accept all the questionable happenings....I will watch and enjoy with that assumption. Beautiful scenes of Cuba captured..... Waiting for Park Bo Gum!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Am I the only one who’s going to watch this drama bc of PO????? I\\'ve seen lots of people focusing more about PBG-SJK-SHK relationships lol I dont blame them because I also cant help myself and wondering. But more than that, I\\'m excited to see Bo Gum on drama again. Its been too long.. Still waiting T.T UMmmm..I like the summery but im still going to give it a go cuz my fave actor is the MC , but not really digging his hair lul:( I\\'m waiting eagerly I\\'m waiting patiently here! This drama is going to prove how good/excellent of an actress SHK is! @Fv dont wven dare to compare my ahjusshinwith this drama?!! Like thats a big insult for that masterpiece drama. It has different lvlls from all of this Hope that the story wil come out like My Ahjussi’s. Many people criticize it for the lead’s age gap and intriguing summary. Hope that the plot will prove us all wrong!!!! i\\'ll give it a try when it comes out but can you just imagine the conversation since you know her husband is like best buddies with bo-gum and always helping each other with their projects. So excited for this drama, they say they\\'ll be filming in Cuba (my mothers country), i\\'m so excited and i\\'m sure if they get approved most of the Cubans will be ecstatic since they\\'re Korean Drama obsessed. So egggcited for this drama.latest article pls. Who can judge a drama just by reading the summary? So both leads have a hobby of reading books. I\\'m not happy with the people who judge their \"chemistry\" Just looking at the cast, I can already see the struggle in chemistry. They don\\'t match at all (for me).. Can’t wait to seeeeee????? I want Jang Nara as female lead please! Cant wait for this drama. Kya! Fans of SHG since autumn tale. Fans PBG since Reply 1988. Big hit cast. I don\\'t know who this writer is, but the two dramas he/she has done before this isn\\'t enough to form a solid conclusion on his/her entire career. So let\\'s not judge the entire drama before its even released and trust that people are capable of improving, and that ppl like PBG, who have never failed to disappoint us in the past, picked a story they thought were worth acting. You see, people also said the same thing abt the synopsis, cast, etc of dots, but what happened? Now think again... Writer is really bad, but only hope is director, actors and tvn. Seriously people? This drama hasn\\'t started, yet you guys keep on complaining just because of the synopsis and the writer? C\\'mon it\\'s a synopsis, it only gives you a general idea about the story plot, obviously it won\\'t give you spoilers. Duh. And the writer? Watch his movies first before judging, that\\'s it. See and evaluate it yourself if he\\'s truly a bad or a good writer. Judge it on your own. LOL. Looking forward to this drama. Korea\\'s talent in the entertainment industry shines brighter than anyone elses. Lately there have been a lot of doctors, lawyers, time travels, police storys, robots, gods and gobblins. This drama will be a refreshing change. Noooooo lmao why did these two even accept this drama?? Ok obviously I can understand why PBG agreed to act in a drama with SHK... But what\\'s with her? The storyline could work in a Korean movie but this will never work in a Korean DRAMA, come on! Also, as someone pointed out, looking at the writer\\'s works, while her movies were not bad, her dramas were boring as hell... I\\'ll give them a chance though, everyone can improve, you never know:) Just read the description but I think it gonna be a hit drama! looking forward to this drama It similar to the story of sunny happiness of mike he and janine chang but in reverse the girl is the divorcee instead of a guy which is mike hee and he had a child and song hye kyo too in this drama then mike hee meets janine chang in reverse in korea which is bo gum im a fan of song hye kyo but not bo gum so I\\'m gonna check it out @Gdsa Pretty noona season 2 in the making. Just hyping about the cast with worst storyline Agree with @TnT this drama just selling the cast. The writter is really bad, it\\'s my first time ever to post a comment on any kdrama, and most likely on anything else. having the talented angel bogum with the giant song hye kyo is a blast for any kdrama fanatic.. cant wait for it Good or not , this drama is gonna be big in korea,lol maybe thats all they are aiming for--good ratings.. Personally like many others, I don\\'t like this pairing either but lets see.. If TvN picks it up then I may have some hope hehe This drama just sell PBG&SHK. The story seems really bad. I didn\\'t see any chemistry with them. Are they gonna make My Ahjussy sequel My Ahjumma???. SHK is really beautiful but, they don\\'t suit each other. I prefer SHK x Won Bin or Kim So Hyun x PBG. This drama surely will ruin both of their carrer. I was looking forward to another park bo gum drama..but now am disappointed, i want to watch a couple where i forget they are acting for a moment and enjoy the story,but with song hye koo ill always be thinking that its just an act and wont enjoy the drama..why didnt they cast park bo gum with someone else..so sad will watch support songpark couple I remember seeing them together on stage at KBS Drama Awards in 2016 (where she won the Grand Prize and he won Best Actor) and I thought it would be nice if they worked together sometime... Happy to see it\\'s actually happening. Can\\'t imagine the actor together with the actress...is it a love couple? wife with one of the good mates thats intriguing While there is young actress and pretty why song hye kyo ..too old for bogum...kim so Hyun and bogum will be matching couple the casting is not the problem here, the writer is the same writer of entertainer and bel ami, both of which has failed. this might be a stain on shk and pbg careers. I just loooooove Park bo gum.. He is an amazing actor. I love his personality and his talent. I\\'m so proud to see him in a new drama.. So excited for this.. And of course Song hye kyo is a great actress herself. She is experienced in this field.. So I\\'m super excited for the drama.. All the best..??❤ ... idk about the casting wouldn’t it be weird considering song hype kyo and Song Joong-Ki are married and Song Joong-Ki and Park no gum are friends... and now shk and pbg are in a drama together.:. Like Ik it’s there job but still.... M big fan of SHK... But I won\\'t able to watch dis... I don\\'t like the plot... The main lead actor line seems like weak... Omo! There\\'s already alot of bashing and bad comments even though its not started yet. Watch it first before your going to judge everything. Or much better if you make your own drama and cast your idiot self. I hope there\\'s no love line like My Ajushi please. Its better for this type of story to have no love line. Please. I\\'m excited to see this! I love both actors. I find it amusing how everyone keeps saying the age gap is too big and that they have no chemistry. Have you ever seen them act together before? Maybe wait before judging? Also, what\\'s wrong with the age gap? So long as they are both of legal age it shouldn\\'t matter. My gosh... My Ahjumma.... LOL ahhhhhhhhh love this omg i don\\'t like it.......noooooooooooooo....bo gum she is like a sister in law.how can this happen??i don\\'t want to imagine. I was so underrated my ahjussi drama when they announced the cast back then. IU is too young to be paired with LSK. But I literally ate my own thinking after I watched the drama, I love it very much. the best drama of 2018 so far. I was so underrated my ahjussi drama when they announced the cast back then.

But I literally ate my own thinking after I watched the drama, I love it very much. the best drama of 2018 so far. I rather choose IU or other single actresses to be partnered with Par Bo Gum. I like SHK but i think..no chemistry between them. They can be partnered but this time it cannot be. Park Yoo Chun..Ji Sung, Rain, Kim Rae Wion can be with her partner. She\\'s like his sister-in-law in real life. He really thinks song joong ki as an older brother. And the age difference is huge. Why do they keep casting leads that have A huge age gap together?! cliché Andweee... Please accept it song hye kyo.. cross finger I am going to watch it because of hye kyo.. I love her acting.. I think they have good chemistry ❤❤ They sooo look good together for a noona-dongsaeng relationship! I\\'m so up fo this! I\\'m not sure they\\'ll match each other, maybe because SHK is too old for bogum? I\\'m in for Park Bo Gum, but I don\\'t want Song Hye Kyo. They don\\'t have chemistry and SHK is a so-so actress.:( I want to see their collaborations. I think it will turn good:)',\n",

       "  'comments': 'I watched it only because of Shin Hye Sun..... I\\'m not really a fan of Lee Jong Suk\\'s acting (unpopular opinion ). I just didn\\'t feel much for his character through his acting. That being said TO ME I didn\\'t feel his love or longing for her at all! Shin Hye Sun is an amazing actress and I\\'m so happy for her. I liked the story overall of course besides what I mentioned above. It\\'s 3 episodes on Netflix because the episode length is 1hr. It says 6 episodes because the SBS airs it as 30min episodes. why it has il untepisode 3 in netflix? and i guess it was not a series at all. too short for a series my heart is broken, but my heart is happy, sad, crying,, I don´t know!! no.. I´m crying... The one available on Netflix, is it complete? Here it says 6 episodes. But the one on Netflix only has 3... It thought the ending was off, I want to know how people reacted and etc. But kinda think that was the ending, that dance on the boat and them looking to the sea. If you miss While you Were Sleeping cast, watch this. I love how the cast is a mash up (slightly) from Legend of the blue sea A d While you were sleeping. This makes the drama very relaxing and makes the audience feel comfortable with the whole drama. The acting is very spot on and I love how every actors really feel the mood of this sad and tragic drama. this drama just broke my heart, these two actors are perfect especially Shin Hye Sun who made me cry every time she cried, we find a lot of cast actors while you\\'re slepping it \\' is pretty cool. Regarding this end it is really sad its my even worse when we know that it is inspire actually. this is definitly my favorite min drama 3 of the cast are also in while you were sleeping with lee jong suk Such a beautiful yet tragic story, oh the pain... i can\\'t handle my tears for falling down watching those two tragic lovebirds.... this is definitely one of the best of 2018 The pain really pierced deeply in me..the sacrifices and pain that they been through was too hard.... They wanted to live they wanted to breath they wanted freedom and they wanted love...it was painful that at the end they both decided to loose their life....probably the pain they felt was intense.. that\\'s probably why they choose death.. And they end their misery together... They were hurt, suffering ,lost but they know that their love will keep them together...the acting was just great i felt the intense and the emotion and message of the whole story... It\"s been three days since I saw Hymn of Death in Netflix but couldn\\'t get over the pain,love and suffering of Woo-Jin and Shem Deok. It was a perfect acting,so real that touches the heart. I just wonder if they were alive today, their story is beyond Romeo and Juliet! Congratulations to the Actors, Director and production staff! Korea must be proud of this beautiful work of art! This short drama was packed with great actors and actresses. It was beautifully directed and made me cry along with the leads. Love both Shin Hye Sun and Lee Jong Suk! This was actually a very refreshing watch since it was short 3 hour drama (sort of like a long movie), but hit all the right notes. Definitely recommended! Shin Hye-Sun did such a great job in her role. I was amazed when I was watching her every move and how it looked like this was really happening to her. I have seen fantastic actors in the South Korean industry, but this was definitely award winning work! Im once again very overwhelmed by shin hye sun acting.. I cried she truly very good actress.. She deserves to be pair with lee jung suk!! Beautifully directed. Once again I have fallen for Lee Jung Suk. And Shin Hye Sun never disappoints. Such a beautiful tragic love story. No actor could have executed the feelings so well. Director nim PD nim and all other workers have done a great job. All the characters made good acting skills. Shin hye sun and Lee Jung sook are also great actors All those praises for Lee jong suk, but im here for Shin Hye Sun. She has proved once again how amazing her acting is, during the beach scene, she asked him to hold on to her. She acts so well I can feel her pain. T__T it has been such a long time since they have offered sth like this, kdramas have so many romantic ones that this kind of drama is so rare. i cry i lot when the actress know , the one he love is married Why is the song \"hymn of death\" not included as ost in this drama? I\\'m looking forward to hearing it. I hope lee jong suk and shin hye sun can be the main character for the upcoming drama 2019 also i hope the story will end with happiness sweet drama but it\\'s too tragic. i can\\'t stop crying. i love u shin hye sun lee jong suk. so sad and beautiful!!!!!!!!!!!!! every bit of it.......words aren\\'t enough to express all feelings brought about by this ... excellent acting I love this drama and the story because it was a real event. But still a don\\'t like my feeling when I watch this. My heart felt very heavy and I would feel sad for hours. At least 7 of the casts are from while you were sleeping. Dang! I love this drama. The cast and all the staff perfect. I wish they will be in another movie together who else here notice that some of the cast are from while you were sleeping???? This is amazing and interesting!!! First short drama. I like jongsuk and hyesun together, my first time to see jongsuk with a prettiest and good actress ever. They have good chemistry together and both. I did not know they were in drama before. Why I didn\\'t know? They are perfect couple. I think Lee jung suk still in military? I know that the premise of this is a sad love story but i am going to watch bcos of shin hye sun though lee jong suk too is equally good. This lady draws me to her acting... Having watched the first episode, I can already say that, I like a lot. I\\'ve not seen the show yet, but the OST is prolly 가심만 알죠 (Only Heart Knows) by Sohyang. can i know the song at the end of the first episode anyoneee???? I really like the first episode as I thought the actors are perfect, Lee Jong Suk and Shin Hye Sun are so beautiful together I\\'m sorry but LSJ has a better chemistry with SHS than with Han Hyo Joo is his best partner for me, I can not wait for the next episode I want them together even if it\\'s tragic. My last watched drama was mr. Sunshine. Eventough both drama have different story line, i stil can\\'t moving on from mr.sunshine\\'s feeling. What should i do:\" Did anybody else notice the crossover in ep 2? The Bar/Club named carpe diem looked just like the one in Chicago typewriter!! It’s not the same Director but maybe the same writer or producer? I am here because of Kim Sohyang. She is the ultimate vocalist in South Korea and some say, the world. I also love to watch LJS shows. They are usually of high entertainment value and he is an amazing actor. But like I said, I am here because of Sohyang. @Taurean Reign it\\'s actually about 8 actors/actresses: lee jongsuk, kim wonhae, hwang yeonhee, shin jaeha, oh eui-sik, lee sangyeob, jang hyunsung, and bae hasun. Is it different with love lies movie? I think both of them have similar story? 3 episode only? Why? It is Special drama? It is a coincidence that they are 4 actors in this drama that were in \"While You Were Sleeping\". Hahahaha! I will watch this drama. The lighting is so good. Plus, Hye Sun This is going to be good!! I know it. Only with the teaser i think i will cry. Shin Hye Sun My fav actress and Lee Jong suk in the same drama i can’t wait Is This A Reunion of School 2013? LMAOOO This one is giving me Intermezzo (Leslie Howard-Ingrid Bergman) vibes. I can\\'t believe LJS kept that hair for this drama. Clearly SHS is making more of an effort. Sighs. What\\'s going on? I thought this is supposed to show last September. Why there is no update on this kdrama? Is this still gonna show or not? finally a same-age couple lol. When is this going to be released? I am excited to see Lee Jong Suk and Shin Hye Sun together. The person below to say Suk should do another drama with HyoJoo needs to grow up. Suk is going to do many dramas with other great actresses. Stop with negative comments because you want your shipper to never act with beautiful women. Shin Hye Sun is the best actress. SHS is the Rating Queen. Two of her drama as the female lead got the highest rating in their respective slots: KBS MGL was around 46 & SBS Still 17 was around 12 (the highest for a cable channel). Please dont comment negatively. Thank u What\\'s happening ..dont mean to say that shin hye sun is a bad actress.. She\\'s fine ...but not a match couple with lee jong suk...they are not seriously...wish lee jong suk and Han hyo joo will cast together in other drama I am so excited!!! Two of the best actor and actress together after 5 years. I wish it was longer than 2 ep! Yeayy lee ji hoonnn ♡♡ When you know your favorite leads are going to have a tragic ending, you sort of wonder whether you can handle watching it... sooo love the two lead picks... but i hate the plot of tgis drama @saro kekekekekeke heol......Shin Hye Sun is an amazing actress, that\\'s why she was picked. The drama wouldn\\'t have been able to be 1st consecutively without her and the rest of the cast. She\\'s soaring!!!!! <3 LJS is my favorite, but why SHS? Her performance was just bad in MGL! Bad acting. Ahh a historical drama about Japanese invasion in Korea. I\\'m gonna love it Im just annoyed at leejongsuk fangirls I mean loving your oppa is good but do you really have to discredit shs hardwork? I saw a lot of negative comments directed at shs not just on this site. Please be reminded that shs isn\\'t just some kind of a pretty face who keeps on getting roles just because she is pleasing to the eyes. shs is a very good actress and it just took her 1 lead role to prove that. am i the only one who thinks of shin hye sun as the female lead when lee jong suk announced this drama he\\'s participating in? I sense it because of how well praised SHS is in korea right now. Reunion of school 2013?LJS SHS LJH all 3 of them were on school 2013 I\\'m just annoyed that all dramas that I find interesting are always snatched by Lee Jong Suk. I hope he act seriously this time around. I think LJS more capable than SHS..i\\'m not worried their acting but more worried about their chemistry..who said LJS not capable i guess their don\\'t know ever him..actually i\\'m not expect her..i really want to see LJS worked other actress..but well who knows LJS can make a magic..fighting!!!! LJS is a very good actor in every role. SHS just proven herself in MGL. Yaah SHS is more capable than LJS and you could judge it only based on MGL drama solely. Can\\'t wait for the SP to come and once again cry a river again for SHS You realize writing on here won\\'t change anything at all? And you have it the wrong way. That SHS is more capable than LJS. LJS is more capable than SHS. So please change the female lead. Wow. Am I the only one who finds it weird that Shin Hye Sun is Cast with Lee Jong Suk?? In my opinion, she is way more capable than him (her outstanding performance in My Golden Life is proof) and she actually takes on serious, “non-fictional” roles. Lee Jong Suk’s dramas are usually fictional, though I must say he sure knows how to pick his dramas well, that guy, even though he may not be a top notch actor (in my personal opinion, he’s overrated and there are far better actors than him out there). yay shin hye sun unni fighting Shin hye sun is way better than LJS ,i wish she would be matched with another actor.maybe her next drama They ever worked together at School 2013..and also in one class in high school.. Thank God it\\'s Shin Hye Sun... they both gonna look superb together ❤❤ Shin Hye Sun <3 Lee sung kyung unni please because they are comfortable with each other and are good friends please unni Kim Ji Won as lead female please Let kim sae ron of mirror of the witch be his leading lady it is tragic...because they both died together, jump from the ship... Even Yun Shim Deok Died at young age..29... i hope kim so hyun playing as yun sim deok, please make kim so hyun and lee jong suk together on drama ^^ i hope kim so hyun playing as yun sim deok, please make kim so hyun and lee jong suk together on drama ^^ A tragical fate and adultery? Hard pass, even if it\\'s LJS...:( I read the fate end tragically... I wonder who the female lead will be? Pretty exciting to see who they cast. Good on LJS though for securing the role. ❤️ cant wait oppaaa... fightingg I wonder if Lee Jong Suk will reject. It\\'ll be his first time playing as a married man and adultery. Only 2 episodes??? okay.',\n",

       "  'comments': 'Nice plot, poor casting. Many of the newbies are so horrible, if I see them in other dramas I would not even give them another chance. Haha out of curiosity I do watch every 5th episodes fast forwarding mostly, hope it ends soon. Love this drama so much.... seriously who would consider shin go-eun a good actress? 120 Episodes Wtf, except Shin Go-Eun the rest sucks at acting I like the story but 120 ep man thats too much time and i can\\'t watch all that bcuz of one good actress and a story -_- i rather wait and just watch the last episode even if i already know how the drama gonna end . Nice drama Isn\\'t this Im Yoon Ho\\'s first lead role? Congrats to him, I\\'ll check it out for sure when I get some free time. I saw him last in a drama where he played someone who received a heart transplant. He was sickly there and here he\\'s got an incurable disease? I love this already, 4days a week? Hell yeah 120 episodes? Hello and Goodbye. Pfttt. As if it ever went away. To be \"back\", it needs to have disappeared but it has always been round lol Here we go on the Merry-go-Round! The incurable disease trope is back! LOL! Agreed DW.... Ridiculous plots, cliché characters, tropes galore......, but I keep coming back! I love them!! Another weekly airing soap opera. Damn, I\\'m too addicted to them even though almost all of them suck and are filled with idiotic characters and ridiculous plot elements. At first, I thought the female lead was Jang Na-Ra based on this picture but it looks like she\\'s new so congrats to her for her first lead. And Im Yoon Ho is not familiar to me either. Looks like he\\'s been gone from the drama world for awhile but comes back as a male lead and his first. That\\'s awesome to see. wow, im waiting for this',\n",

       "  'comments': 'so sad:(( Bae Soo Bin Oppa never lets down his fans... @Shannah- You mean Joon Seo Mother Na Kyung? Jae Wook’s Mum is elderly. Oh no only 8 episodes left!!! This drama is so moving. I am specially touched by the love of Ji Young and Min ho for their son. A doctor would never indulge information who just walks in and asks questions about a patient. A doctor would not leave an open file open for a unknown to see anyone\\'s contact information either. Am I the only one who hate Jae Wook\\'s mother? She\\'s so annoying and above all dumb. She always defends her evil daughter in law even if she knows her behavior. That\\'s why Na Kyung keeps on her wrongdoings because there\\'s someone who supports her I don\\'t get it. Will someone please explain to me how Ji-Young and Jae-Wook have a 2nd baby that it will be a match for bone marrow transplant when neither of them are a match. Then how can the baby be a match? Even from the start I like the character of min ho. He is such a wonderful person who loves his family. I wish I could have someone like him who is soo understanding loving, mrtyr in love, thoughtful, responsible, selfless and a man of dignity. The hell with those who are greedy and money oriented people. Min ho and hyun woo are examples of people who are willing to give life for the happiness of the ones they loves. Might not finish this. I’m annoyed with almost everyone in the show except Min Ho and Hyun Woo. Poor Min Ho, I wish he would just leave her. He and Hyun Woo could still have a father-son relationship without them being together. Every girl should find a man like Song Min Ho. I hope she doesn\\'t get back with that liar and cheater ex-husband. Can\\'t believe she still has feelings for him. Somehow, the woman in drama always forgives their cheating husbands. Please don\\'t give up on a good thing for trash. love everything on this show so exciting and so sad Oh Yoon-Ah plays a similar role in \"Saimdang, Light\\'s Diary\" bitter, resentful, covetous and consumed with jealousy. Where is the 21st episode? What??? No episodes until the 5th January?? I’m dying of curiosity here for 21 to 24 subbed eps. Am so loving the characters and storyline so far. Great scriptwriting and brilliant acting from everyone. Ji Young is nailing her role and I’m with her all the way. I must be the only one that wants her back with Jae Wook. She is still deeply in love with him regardless of the betrayal and the fact that they’re both married to other people. This drama is an emotional train wreck and there are no clear winners in the end. I just can’t wait for that snake Na Kyung to get all her just desserts. You reap what you sow lady and Ji Young please show no mercy to that heartless conniving spineless wrench! The storyline is somehow similar to the Filipino Movie \"One More Try\". Try watching it guys. I pity the ex husband...he was forced to marry that woman to save his ex mother in law. He kept the secrets to himself..he didn\\'t moan..he accepts everything that comes to him..of course it\\'s because he made a mistake but who doesn\\'t make mistake?? He couldn\\'t blame anyone but himself I always shed tears whenever I watch this drama. I can\\'t help but cry. Min ho is such a wonderful husband and step father. Is there any man in real world that is like him?,Iam falling inlove with this kind of man.hoping that hyun woo would not die in the end coz i might cry a river if that happens. I\\'m hooked to this drama, I can\\'t even imagine what is going through the mother\\'s mind when she hear the only solution for treating the deadly illness is to have another sibling to save your kid, I would do it in a heart beat, and give a sh..t about what people think, if you are not a parent you can not imagine how hard is to lose a child. As for the husband, I would not go back to him, he is a coward, a piece of trash as well as his whole family (including the aunt because she has a plan). I just hope for a good if not a happy ending. I really pity the present husband cuz he’s cool and nice what goons happen if she leave him? Absolutely one of the best story ever. wow wow 3 bombshells in this drama alone can not ask for more han chae young, oh yoon ah and the ex miss korea oh hyun kyung they are more than 170cm taller beauties with shapely sculptural bodies wow wow im only here cuz of these 3 ladies tho the storyline is interesting and entertaining @Teami: Right?! why is he always playing the bad guy? but at the same time, he doesn\\'t even have to accept these type of roles so maybe he likes it. The story is somehow similar to Philippine’s star cinema movie entitled “One More Try” Just saw a vid of Han Chae Young’s character fully pregnant sitting in a cafe and all I can say is in the 30 seconds Im hooked I had to go and search for the drama as everything is written in Hangul and of course I find the synopsis and cast listing here! What a bloody great story; Im in! A woman\\'s kid has leukemia, so she goes to the hospital with her old husband instead of her new one. I don\\'t know in what universe this makes sense. In another scene, she learns about her old husband\\'s infidelity, so she\\'s slapping her own face multiple times to check if she\\'s not dreaming. As if someone would really do that. The rest of the script is just as cringeworthy. It\\'s like I am watching a telenovela or a soap opera. Too bad, because I loved the director\\'s previous work \"A Thousand Kisses\". Hopefully, he\\'ll find a better script next time. Hopefully Bae soo bin\\' s character doesn\\'t cheat in this drama. The poor guy has been typecast as the forever cheating husband/boyfriend in drama land. It hurts to see one of your fave actor playing a douche. Story line sounds amazing!! Waiting eagerly!! oooooooh cant wait love this cast han chae young unni welcome back fighting!!!!!!!',\n",

       "  'comments': 'At first, I thought this drama was boring compared to The Guest. But after ep3, I could move on to the end with excitement. Priest let us know few ways of doing exorcisms, compared to The Guest with only one way. Both have their own unique aspect rather than other Kdrama. Nb:I kept seeing JI Il Joo in similar smiling face with Ichihara Hayato. They often close half of their eyes... Worth watching drama especially for horror-thriller lovers SPOILER WARNING but i\\'ll be including very few details with this ending, dare bet that there will be sure be a season 2. like the plot, and all the casts. But, why ratings so low? I didn’t expect it’ll be like this..plot twist after plot twist..mind blowing plot..I feel a bit sad for our soomin and ham eunho..they go through many things and didn’t expect the ending will be like this..I demand for season 2??if it’s possible!!the members of 643 regia are all charming..//SPOILER// I know that OCN and this drama is not sbout love,but to think what soomin and eunho had go through,I just want them to be together..But I still like this ending,they are still together although Soomin didn’t remember Eunho.. Best plot twist in kdrama. I somehow liked the ending. Who is the one that playing samael tho I can\\'t find him anywhere best plot twist ever! glad i didnt drop this drama >< SAMAEEEEL!!! Yepp! may we avoid the tricks of the devil. I like a plot that is a little but very deep and meaningful. looks really pure love. The attraction between Woo Jin and Yoo Mi also strengthens the emotional story. Eun Ho\\'s affection for friends and patients also touched me. and I am waiting for the next yoo mi drama genre is the same as prist. @Mulfan Samael is one of falling angels or demon in bible. Sooo just like lucifer .. he doesnt need story to exposed his character? Must watch drama! Samael, who are you seriously...no one cant tell me who he is? Poor soomin his memory lost again.. Goodbye priest, maybe we can see their action featuring the guest cast next time, hahaha Woahh mindblown. Must watch drama! Plot twist were amahzingg. Bittersweet ending. Hats off to the writers~ Loved all the characters. To those who havent started, go watch now! Daebak plot twist. Didn\\'t see it coming Wowwwwww the end of ep14 was insaneeee! I think the writer should make this drama longer!!!! Me and my sister love the drama so bad!!! Ep.12\\'s plot twist was all good cos no unnecessary sacrifice , but ep.14 was abit predictable. Wish the script writer could have added more intelligence to the good guys, by not putting them in a very predictable situation whereby the holy mother-of-pearl box was damaged by the unholy being and they were nearly knocked down by a driverless car. Is the devil kinda like the guest\\'s park il do story? Maybe i forget or the story already exposed? Excellent twist at the end of 12th episode... I didn\\'t expect such twist in the story...hatsoff to the screenwriter I never plan to give it up.. I accepted that it will be a little better than the guest. But after episode 12???? Waaaaaah omg.. Best plot twist in kdrama!!!!! Must watch suuuuuper.. Loving it soooo much??? Daebakkkk The Plot Twist!!!!! love it so much!! Its like a writer\\'s slap on those who gave up on the story and compared it to the guest. After Ep 4 unfolds the red light I knew something is up. this is the best plot twist kdrama i ever watch!!!!!!! Whoa what a twist at the end of ep 12. Definitely must watch!! I just want to say Love this drama!!!! Omoooo I didnt expect the 12th episode to end that way. Cant wait for next week. It is totally insane!!!! Daebak!!! You must all watch. Devil follower is soomin\\'s mother? What happen:\"( What i curious is who is Dr. Lee kyung sung? Soo min mention it in episode 11, i think i had never listen that name before, then..what i think is maybe the devil follower is soo min\\'s father, any spec? i really curious whats going on in episode 11 and next episodes.. Why it didn’t broadcast this week? Iam curious about the episode 11 and 12 what will happen Cant wait for ep 11...I cried at the end of Ep 10 I started this drama with high expectations after the guest, but I am disappointed. the storyline has a lot of holes and to be honest even the cast is not that good. why it didnt broadcast this week? The drama will brodcast next week, aaahhh I can\\'t wait I can\\'t wait for ep 11 and so on. Somehow I felt like sister haemin is the voodoo practitioner.... cant wait for the plot twist for this drama I think father moon is devil follower???? why this drama have a low rating? Or is it Dr Ham is also one of the devil follower? I really cant wait for ep 11 I think father moon is the devil followers. Twist he couldn\\'t kill him self because he had been controlled by the devil. At the end of ep 10, why i think Dr. Jung and Dr. Kim are followers of demon??????? at the end of ep 10, is the hooded lady serving the demon Dr Ham? it\\'s so intriguing that makes me anxious.. next episodes makes me nervous >.< what\\'s going on, someone is controlling the evil spirit and making it possessing people, things get out of control after father moon dead, and the return of the old nun is just too fishy, there is something going on with her. someone is trying to steal the box and trying to kill the members of 643 regia, I bet that old nun is up to no good, that\\'s why she\\'s trying to make oh soo-min leave the church since he\\'s the only priest left who can do exorcism, so if he leave then there is no more priest to do exorcism, to curse a priest right inside of a church is no simple task but whoever it is did curse bishop kwak and trying to get rid of him and jung yong-pil. can\\'t wait Father Oh and Doc.Ham both know each others 8 years ago.Back before,Dr.Ham and Father Oh career were as a doctor.They also planned to go to Venezuela together and married.But,Dr.Nam and Father Oh got possed by the demon,Father Moon was the one who exocirsm them.As a energumen,they both lost their memories.But,Father Moon knew that it was not the end,he knew the demon was after Dr.Ham and will not stop cashing her.So,Father Moon trained Father Oh as a exocirsm priest in order to save Dr.Ham,the women he love after he lost his mother due to the same case. What is the song being played in the ending of each episode? The thrilling or chilling song. With everything that happened at Episode 7 and 8... I was literally confused and shookt. It felt like everything was rushed and I am already watching Ep 14 something but then the preview.... The game is on once again. We\\'ll now know Father Oh and Dr Ham\\'s past.... and this sister Hae Min...I cant wait to know more about her. It seems like all priests respect her like she\\'s a deity or something.... and that is really suspicious for me..... @Tim: it\\'s not only in Korea - it\\'s universal, all Roman Catholic priest can\\'t get married as he is married to the Church. According to the Scripture, Christ was not married (except in a mystical sense, to the Church). By remaining celibate and devoting themselves to the service of the Church, priests more closely model, configure themselves to, and consecrate themselves to Christ. So is moon priest dead anot? Interesting , just loved it , good story , good work I love this drama. Wow. Damn Episode 6 got me so excited!!!! This drama is seriously getting interesting! The leads are surely great and I love how the stories of every leads are slowly unveiling! I\\'m really curious with the connection of Father Soo Min and Doctor Ham and what does Father Moon have to do with their forgotten past and with the demon. I agree with Mr Tim. A synopsis in another website said that Oh was a doctor , but he quit and became a priest . In other articles , it also said that Father Moon is more careful because of the accident that happened 8 years ago . So my prediction is: eight years ago both Oh and Dr Ham were new doctors/medical students at the same university with Dr Jeong (the psychiatrist) as their sunbae . Maybe they were dating at that time , and planning to go to Venezuela but then something horrible came up , maybe possesions or demonic attacks . Oh and Dr Ham lost their memories (it could be they\\'re forced to forget) and separated . this is getting interesting, after watching episode 6, I believe that oh soo-min and the doctor known each other and 8 years ago they both lost their memory, also oh soo-min wasn\\'t a priest before, at the end of episode 6 the male doctor said this \"it\\'s quite strange, you\\'re not the same person from before, why did you come to this hospital? and as a priest at that, can you not remember as well\", they all known each other the female doctor and the two priests, I guess oh and female doctor were possessed by this demon, now the demon coming back for them, and priest moon seems to hide something. I\\'m interesting in what happen next, will wait for more. the reason oh soo-min attracted to the female doctor is because he known her but the memory hasn\\'t come back yet so he got this feeling that he known her but couldn\\'t remember. this drama is good but if compare to \"the guest\" this one is bit lacking, and hope there won\\'t be any romance in this one (read somewhere that in Korea catholic priests are not allowed to get marry). the female lead is a bit lacking in emotion especially while confronting the devil. one thing in common between this drama and the guest is that they both chasing the same evil spirit, but in the guest it is park ii do, however this one is an unknown evil spirit, but \"the guest\" storyline is more solid since everything tide together nicely, connection between characters and background stories are all well organized, one story lead to the next, ad there is an origin for everything, park ii do got his own little story. OCN air the the two dramas so close together (even though not back to back) but viewers couldn\\'t help but compare the two. well I\\'ll continue to watch this one and see how it turn out. I really love how this drama is going.....It\\'s so mysterious and interesting. I believe there will be a big plot twist that is waiting to be unveiled....I hope I won\\'t be disappointed with this especially that I\\'m a big fan of Yeon woo Jin ❣ Very scary, mysterious and interesting drama. This drama is boring. I like The Guest better because the story is more quick paced, and this drama is so slow. I am loving this drama, well i\\'ve watched the guest and love that too. the rated for the guest is 15 and priest 19. Actually i watched the first episode for priest in the library of my uni, and for f sake, i screamed lol. the guest and priest both are good and scary on their way. the guest is violent and more thirller for me, but still scared me in a way. I mean the murderer case and park il do LOL, damn that name. priest is scary, the pallet in this drama is just dark, well from the first episode it\\'s kinda dark. Priest took this \"GHOST\" thing more i think, well i\\'m still recovering from my scared on eps 2 like:). looking forward for eps 4 and geting scared all over again. I really dislike the woman doctor.. so nosy and arrogant, and she keeps trying to white-knight the boy in a completely annoying fashion. She already saw him jump from the ceiling and bite her, so why is she trying so hard to stop the exorcism? I hope she gets more pleasant or just dies Wow! now this drama will continue to nerve-wracking us after The Guest. But Seriously?? Park Il Do again?? LOL just let\\'s not mention that haunted name... sometimes it\\'s haunting me, I woke up at 1/2/3 am hahaha i like the story and the cast, but i don\\'t like how they made the female doctor\\'s character. so annoying.... hoping the character will change over time. They\\'re keep asking for the demon\\'s name. It\\'s Park Il Do, damn it!;> this drama is surprisingly good!. just watch alone it is bit creepy. hello park il do:) This could be a trilogy. First: The Guest, Second: Priest. Father Yang and Father Choi was actually a member of 643 Regia. Lol. The third installment would be The Nun. hahah. Anyways I really love OCNs thriller-horror stories. HAHHA that Park Ildo comment cracked me up park il do?????? are you back again???? Can\\'t wait to see Yeon Woo Jin in this drama. I\\'m looking forward to this drama! After the guest, I\\'m really looking forward to this! The Guest is so much of a horror story for me but it\\'s well written! So OCN, please make this level (or even higher) with The Guest! I love how OCN dramas are diverse and non mainstream!! oh yeah 2 more weeks guys, this will be Saturday and Sunday nights taking over after \"the player\", so don\\'t make a mistake and wait for it on Wednesday and Thursday nights, these two nights would be god\\'s quiz season 5, never watch this show before, but I\\'m in for some more horror, would love to watch this at midnight when I have trouble sleeping. Aftr the guest, will see this Hope it comes soon... Yes!!!! Yeon Woo Jin!❤️ This drama looks more scary than The Guest.. Hope so This seems really scary!! I\\'m so excited for this drama but I bet I\\'m gonna have a few sleepless nights after watching it. Ohhh another drama like the Guest? I\\'m depressed cause it\\'s almost about to end, so I hope this drama can fill it\\'s space. Another creepy drama, OCN? This kind of drama is never my cup of tea. I always have concern whether to continue watching The Guest but I keep up with it only because of Kim Jae Wook. Later on I was engulfed in curiosity to know who\\'s Park Il Do, why he do what he did, etc. But I never want to watch this kind of drama again so I\\'ll pass. think of this as an upgrade of \"hand: the guest\" cause things are moving around and body is flying midair, we don\\'t get this in \"hand: the guest\". This new show is like \"the exorcist\" Korean version. can\\'t wait, I would like to see lee je-hoon play the lead role, wonder why he didn\\'t accept the role. ugh i really dont like ghost drama or anything alike but because I love YWJ i will go for it. And they really planned to release it on november huh give me the creeps gosh. I am really amazed of how hardworking YWJ is since he had 3 dramas in 2017 and i thought he will rest this year, i keep on checking for his update until now and im so happy. I was so sad atfirst when it was june and still heard no news of his upcoming drama, i was gonna accept it but here it is his new drama omg huhuhuhu i know YWJ will make this a great drama to watch i never doubted his acting, his charms are way high and can\\'t contain it. I love oppa Yeon Woo Jin!!! Saranghaeyo keep on acting and I hope you\\'re living life at the fullest. Take care of your health and hoping to see more dramas soon. Every drama is outstanding thank you Oh no! So excited with this one. This will be my first-ever exorcism Kdrama. I hope this will turn out good, since I know Yeon Woo Jin oppa will nail his role again.:) Yeon Woo Jin is my favorite actor???wishing ‘Priest ‘ I love this genre i love OCN style . keep up Seems like OCN cant get over this exorcisms, already see the guest with mateo. Lets see. will watch this one. Yeon Woojin and Jung Yoomi were cast together before in movie The Tunnel. they had good chemistry there. i hope they\\'re good in this too. about exorcisms again, OCN? hmmm sounds similar too The Guest...but, well this from OCN, I can not wait what OCN will give to us again since the concept similar with the guest:) I am such a fan of Kdrama and these actors; sadly I can\\'t watch Priest as I am not comfortable with the dark arts such as exorcisms on screen. I\\'ve always been shy about the satanic subject matter in general. God bless these great actors always and I will keep watch on their next projects. I especially loved Yeon Woo-Jin in Judge vs Judge and other shows.',\n",

       "  'comments': 'In 18 episodes now, cannot bear more of yeh suh\\'s mom\\'s evil doings. She is such a disgusting mom. She accompliced that evil coach & made everyone\\'s life hell. Btw thumbs up to the director & all the actors actresses. They all potrayed their characters perfectly. One of the best, well-paced dramas I\\'ve seen in a long time. The twists and turns kept me so interested all the way through. Longest ending episode I\\'ve ever seen, showing endings for every single character! Kim Byung-Chul...the king of facial expressions...went from pathetic to hysterical...loved him. So completely disagree with Diane\\'s comments below, from her first sentence to the last. Nothing wrong with kids \"finding themselves\", especially after what the character had been through. He\\'ll learn a lot more about life on the road than sitting behind a desk. Plot done many times??? Hmmm...not this way, not by this awesome director. It\\'s rare I don\\'t fast-forward a lot in dramas. Barely did in this one...didn\\'t have to. I wish drama writers would stop telling kids to travel to Europe or America to \"find themselves.\" This is a bad idea. Overall, this was an involving drama, and I\\'m sure it struck a deeper cord in S. Korea. As far as chaebol moms and their kids... the plot has been done many times, but as far as I\\'m concerned, nothing, including this one, can top \"A Wife\\'s Credentials\" from 2012. I beg JTBC, please have a sequel?? it\\'s been 1 month since Sky Castle ended and i miss it so much, showing different family problems with the same characters is fun, and congrats to We All Lie i saw it also topped in Music Bank for OSTs. I\\'m grateful for myself for watching this drama, i learned a lot Brilliant. I have nothing else to add. been watching kdrama more than 15 years and this is one of the best.i cried my heart out watching the last episode? Woo-Joo (chani) congrads for the new song Kim Joo-Young style somehow reminded me of Maya Akutsu sensei from Queen of the Classroom which makes me wanna watch Jyoou no Kyoushitsu again.. Basically everyone in South Korea watched this drama. I just finished it today. It is so good. Anyone who\\'s reading this comment and hasn\\'t watch it, should give a try. You\\'ll get hooked from the first episode. This drama reminds me Avengers Social Club, just a little bit with the same situation that the main story is about parenting and school life, Just imo. But overall this drama was really gooodddd. Im here after knowing brother..actually,this drama has always been in my watch list..But I had to catch up last year drama?? because of my super big and important exam..but then I heard this drama is about education and family,so I give it to go two days ago..and here I am,finished this drama yesterday??while giving up my sleep..this drama is so precious..I like hwang family and seunghye’s family(but not her husband),and coach kim,I just want to smash my handphone..I cried really hard on episode 19,world is full on unfairness..Did I’m the only one like yeh suh then hyena..yeah,yeh suh is brat..but hye na,she is too harsh on people who love her too..Glad that kang’a family repent...the storyline is too good.now I know why they deserve the highest rating drama for now..Full of lesson,show the reality..❤️❤️I wouldn’t mind if there are season 2,although there are different cast and story..although this drama already perfect..and After hearing all the hype about this drama, I decided to give it a go without any expectations and damn, I was blown away! I was immediately hooked after episode 1. The plot was interesting and every episode left me looking forward to more. I absolutely love the fact this drama addresses the issue with parents pressuring their children to be the very best in school instead of nurturing their children to be the best version of themselves by supporting their dreams. I believe it\\'s extremely competitive in S.Korea, but I think it\\'s also a problem in many Asian families so this drama can possibly be a bit of an eye-opener for many families. Anyway, the acting was exceptional. Everyone in this drama did an amazing job at portraying their character. I found myself hating and loving some of these characters because they felt real. No one is perfect and you live & learn. This drama is definitely one of the best dramas Ive watched. The plot is great and the directing is amazing. The suspense moments are enough to make u get interested but it\\'s also not too fast. The only hole I found is at the near end but I guess it\\'s negligible. I love the message of this drama the most, its a very important message for the parents. 10/10 for me This drama is exactly why I don\\'t want my children to go to school in Korea. Im married to a korean, and live in korea. Even he agrees with me to not put our children in school in Korea. He went to one of the most prestigious universities,only because his parents wanted it. He had already found his passion, web design, photography (which he is now one of the most sought after in korea) But he studied bio technology because of his parents. And that\\'s the problem with korea, just as long as you have a university degree, you get in. Like my husband his skill was web design and photography, he studied bio technology... doesnt matter if he had experience before and was so good, no university bye bye. But now with experience since almost 10 years after university, he can change company all he wants and decide his salary, even european companies have contacted him. I\\'m here because jisoo and jennie watch this drama so yeahh? I stopped watching Kdramas for more than a year now. I tried watching some though but I could not bring myself to finish it. Even those dramas that my fave actors starred in. I cried watching Yoon SeA\\'s acting. Absolutely the best. This drama is good but it somewhat makes you sad, that no matter what happen, most of the times, bad reigns.. Amazimg drama? deserves all the hype?? To Gray. There\\'s a little bit of funny moments in this drama, even though it is not the main part of it. I love how the story come up with beautiful plots and all the twists. How they put bunch of comedy scene, how the characters developing It just so great. Honestly I can tell this drama is worth the hype and worth the rating. I\\'m just done watching and still get hangover to thisss ughh. Woaaahhhh this drama daebaakk I cried watching episode 19. Great! is there a comedy in this drama? ok i guess those who say the end of this drama is bad actually they don\\'t understand this drama. for me, I\\'m very satisfied with this drama. from the beginning to the end. one of the best, like signal. overall drama is good...so interesting.. but the ending is suck.. MY REVIEW: SKY Castle Just realized the meaning of SKY at the final episode hahaha. A rly top-notch drama!! I\\'m here bcs of BTS RM.. It\\'s an awesome drama!! like a roller coaster. I felt everything. Sadness, anger, happiness, glad, depressed.. and the after-credit scene is make me curious, I\\'m waiting for the season 2.. SKY castle, jjang!! Wow Good Job SKY Castle..You make me like rollercoaster in the beginning until middle episodes but you make me cry like a baby in 2 last episodes. This is Really Good Drama, I mean I never found drama with story and plot like this.. Thank you for everything in this drama, like how good the writer-nim written this story, directors and staff who did good for made this drama and also all cast for their perfect acts.. I got so many things to learn from this drama, for how to be good parents (soon if I married and have children) and how to be human. I will wait another drama like this..Everyone Fighting on your own, I believe Everyone doing the best for their life:) Wow! Finally finished this drama after 20 episodes and i must say that to anyone wondering whether this drama is worth watching, do yourself a favour and just watch it. This is one of my top 2 dramas for 2018❣Awesome script, awesome cast❣❣Jjang, jjang, jjang! So much to learn from it, especially the last few eps. Indeed, most people learn from extreme pain in order to change for the better, to grow. Highly recommended!! There\\'s an after-credit scene in the final episode.:) DAEBAK!!! god I loved this drama from the first episode!!! good job Yoo Hunmi for writting a really good plot for it. I watched it first for Chani and Choi Wonyoung but fastly Seunghye and Cha family won my heart? the difference is that ma yeo jin/akutsu maya were actually very kind, while coach kim is really evil. omgg i really love this dramaa!!!! @Chibimaruko same! when I first see Coach Kim its reminds me of Akutsu Maya and Ma Yeo-Jin from Queens classroom.. (Japanese&Korean vers) This drama is very unpredictable like other typical korean drama. cuz it told more about family matters rather than love line. i luv itt. this drama was absolutely one of the best. I honestly get goosebumps every episode because It Was That Good!! I recommend this drama, I realized a lot of things so I really don\\'t know why people are getting bored lol Watch It, It Was More Than Worth It!! Coach Kim reminds me a lot to Akutsu Maya in Queens classroom.. @kuwakuwi what is makjang drama? Anyway I am addicted to this drama . Every episode make me wanting to see new one . Thumbs up to the cast . Lov from Manipur , India . I really like this drama. I\\'m a k-drama hard fans who has watch over 100 drama with different genre. Sky castle has taught us a lot of things especially to be a good parents. Loves this drama can\\'t wait for the finale here am i watching this thanks to hwang hyunjin is this not a makjang drama? Cant belive that sky castle beats my fave all time drama reply 1988.. but, when i watched this drama \"okay u deserve it\" @carlete here It can be quite boring for some, most especially to foreigners who do not really understand the education system and high society issues in Korea. Simply because it does not apply to them. But as for Koreans, they know the struggle of going through extreme lengths just to prep for the college exams. The competitive nature of the story surrounding the families is very real especially for Koreans. This kind of mindset and system is a continuous battle for them and that\\'s why Sky Castle lives up to their realities. Well of course, the plot is overly exaggerated for entertainment purposes. THUMBS UP!!!!!??? Nothing compares to this drama. I love it I just can\\'t wait for the finale .it\\'s too much.. Woke up ..no update abt ep19 I’ve been watching this drama, and now on episode 12. but honestly i don’t get the hype. Everyone saying this drama is a mega hit but, as long as i watch this i don’t really agree. I thought this drama has super genre like reply 1988. Can someone give me an answer why is this drama so high rated. Because i found it a little boring and kinda want to stop. I waited for 12 ep but nothing really exciting happen. But i like the cast especially hayoon in A-teen i just started watching this 2 days ago and I\\'m currently at episode 13. i just wanna say that Seojoon Gijoon\\'s mom >>>>>>> every mom in sky castle. I\\'ve waited for one week to watch episode 19 but??? That soccer match emm Need to wait for the next day and next week. I\\'m getting impatient huhuhu I have watched more than 50 Korean series but it\\'s drama it\\'s nothing compared to this.....I used to love romantic Korean series but I just fell in love with this....the actors are superb every single one of them contributed to the amaziness of this drama even miss Kim joo young no matter how much I hate her she acted her part so well....thumbs up to the writer directors and producers u guys did a great job...this drama deserves an award Oh god please give me some energy to wait for this drama I am stalking everywhere for sky castle . From outside Korea , India?? a piece of art!!! it\\'s been years that i wasn\\'t this impressed with a drama One word, Daebak!!! I\\'m impatient so I will watch this drama after ending. I really hateee kang familys ugghhh really highly recommended kdrama for those who like or try to watch kdrama for d 1st time. for getting more than 20% of rating, it was so hard for a kdrama. never been curious n kinda impatient for waiting for next episode of any kdrama before EXCEPT THIS ONE eventhough they gave us slight review for next ep but daaamn that was made me even really hope for next episode I hate most of the character but can\\'t stop watching! Deym! I really like this drama bcs of the plot and the acting of cast itself. But srsly i still waiting for this moment, for someone kill that crazy psychopath witch Kim Joo Young or at least put her in jail Best kdrama so far..... amazing actors?????? I think all of us who watching this drama are so proud because we\\'re watching it while this drama is still airing lol. This drama seriously the best I\\'m super proud of myself!! I was comment number one in this page. I knew this drama would be a hit the day I read the synopsis! At the very least, I knew I would love it even if others didn\\'t. It\\'s gonna hit 25% in the finale y\\'all!! Amazing story, amazing cast, the director saw how amazing it would be when he told the writer to extend the script to 20 eps even before they started shooting!! DAEBAK This is high rating drama. its the same with Goblin NO SPOILERS! I like how the story change to the mystery genre. I think there\\'s something about Teacher Jo. He seems does not like Kim Joo Young too much. Maybe he will be the key answer for Woo Joo\\'s family. Btw, I\\'m impressed by the development of the plot. It is so unpredictable. Jtbc and Ocn dramas far is great than sbs,kbs or mbc dramas. Keep it up! For me, acting 10/10 and storyline 9/10. Pretty sure I\\'ve hated almost every character at certain point in this drama This drama realalllyy awesoomeee Daebak!?? This drama is too good to be true This drama is so good and addictive, I started watching it two days ago and I\\'m already in the 16th episode. WOW..... The plot, the casts, their acting 10/10 It\\'s been such a long time since I last watched a drama, let alone a K-drama. But wow, this is such amazing series in all aspects: acting, writing, direction and cinematography. Good job, JBTC! i really like this drama, because of the story is very very insteresting and we can learn many thing from this drama SPOILER, SPOILER.. Two mistakes of now modern parents learnt from sky castle drama. First, nowadays parents raised their kids just to boast to friends n others. Secondly nowadays parent always said whatever we do are for the goods of their children and eventually they will understand. No spoiler [HIGHLY RECOMMENDED] PLEASE WATCH THIS DRAMA!!! My bad. It was a 20 episode series. I thought it would just end at the 16th episode. I am hooked to this series that\\'s why. More exciting episodes to go. The best drama to be concluded. I\\'ve just finished the finale episode of this series and I was really disappointed and left hanging. How could you do this to us? Is there a season 2 for this? there\\'s a lot of things to settle to call it\\'s the end? Why? Tell me there is a second season and I won\\'t rate this series as a bluff. What happen to Woo Joo. Whag happen to that evil Kim Yoo Jong. Where is justice? We need more than that! Hard to believe hyena aka kim bora is the oldest cast among all the kid in this dram. She even older than Yeri aka park yoona. Wooowww what a baby face she has...!!!! As of Episode 16, Sky Castle has officially gained the HIGHEST Rating from any Cable Drama in Korea. Ignore the haters, ignore your doubts, this drama officially beat Goblin and Reply1988 - if that don\\'t convince you, then have fun missing out ~~ That is all. I tried to become impartial while watching several epusodes but I cant help hating Hye Na..sigh, even if I dont particularly like Ye Suh or her mom. Please get Ms Kim into jail Sky Castle break \\'Reply 1988\\' records highest ever viewer rating in Korean cable television history with 19.243% (AGB Nielsen average rating). this drama really something. I can\\'t help but every episode always made my jaws drops. all cast did really great job. the story smash me to become a nice parents. my kids is not mine, they have life themself. This drama must get award. You never regret to watch this drama. I love this drama The more you watch it, the more you frustated Characters development are great. And every actors and actresses really did a good job portraying their characters. Hope Hyena is alive and this drama is daebak. why hate Hyena?? Shes born just with her mother, study + part timer for pay hospital and Yee Suh get everything she want and her mother Kwak Mi Hyang also pursued HyeNa from organization, her work. Please see from Hyena\\'s perspective!! Why everyone hate hyena...!? I dont think she came for the revenge, like another child hyena also hope for her father love. Since her mom died, its normal a kid look for their father whom still alive and wanted to live there.. JBTC and tvN drama so good!!!! Yeah ByeBye to KBS , SBS , MBC . uhh i really hate Kim Hye-Na cant wait episode 15. best actor seri appa i just watched ep 14 and omg i\\'m so worried about yesuh and her family. This kim joo young is really crazy, she already got into yesuh mind. and Hyena too, she\\'s getting weird. I feel bad about her but she\\'s so manipulative that it\\'s scarier. The women & men on this drama are so pretentious, living on their own fantasies! I\\'d say not in real world! This drama so great even the poster seems like promise it I have watched till ep12 and waiting for more. I dont hate hyena. And i hate kim joo young who is guiding kang ye seo in wrong way. She is becoming worse and worse and even not respecting her own mother . And her mother is turning blind eye for the cruel things did to prev family done by that kim joo young. So cute and heartwarming, the relationship between Soo Han and his mom. The young actors are really killing it in their roles. The drama should win Best Ensemble in K awards shows, if ever there is one. Loving Yoon Se-Ah\\'s portrayal of calm and elegant lady. The lead actresses are all good but she stands out on her interpretation of her character. Among the kids, Kim Bo Ra\\'s eyes speaks volume, just a twitch here and there and you can really relate to what she is feeling, nothing exaggerated. After Mr sunshine, it’s a wonderful drama. Every actors n actresses all play well with their roles. It reflects the society of people who called themselves rich n high education. It also points out the reality of rich people. They are ambitious, greedy about delusional fame. So they force their kids to reach the highest level in education to satisfy their egos n selfishness. Unfortunately, they face the falling down at the bottom. They absolutely fail n regret. They feel ashamed with their consciences. Don’t justify people with their appearance. Their souls n heart are very important. Then to be rich is not happy n famous in this drama maybe in our society. Live your true life is always better!??? 12 episodes in, the only character that I think redeemable is probably Cha Ki-Joon. The rest is just acting out of their personal agenda. Hyena deserved to be happy ... she is very mature for her age. Compare to spoiled Yeh su .. I prefer Hyena. Yeh su mother is terrible Yeh Suh\\'s mom finally discovers that Hye Na is the daughter of her husband. Karma is a b*tch, Kwak Mi Yang. Why everybody hate hye na? She’s nice and I think she’s potrayed like that bcs she has nobody, and the ultimate enemy of her has everybody. I hate ye suh and her mom, although they are the main character of this drama . Such a jerk family who’s always envious with people who’s better then them.. sly lol Sympathy comes from your past experiences, mostly we are the same person with whom we are showing sympathy. I am not from Korea but I feel Korean moms are too much into their children and their personal lives....but surely I can\\'t judge from few dramas, they have shown both parents like woo Joo moms and yeh suh mom\\'s but more dangerous are parents like Cha min hyuk he doesn\\'t know that he is right, ignorant and over confident fools are more dangerous... Hey why everyone hate hyena, what do you expect from a kid who strugle the most? She doesnt have father, her mom died, didnt have money, didnt have mentor. I think she is a good girl who can handle her own life. Im rooting for her because i just want to see her live happy without concern anything and get love from their parents like her friends I\\'m still at ep 4, why ppl here hating on Hyena? Im gonna watch it and figure it out Hyena is lowkey manipulative person,and why kim bora seems have pick the same role with this character? To Hye Na haters, sorry guys but she\\'s bound to end up with Woo Joo. If you\\'re a guy, do you want to have Yeh Suh as a girlfriend? No way in hell! 3 reasons why. 1) She\\'s a spoiled brat who cannot handle failure and doesn\\'t respect anyone when it doesn\\'t suit her. 2) Her sheltered existence makes her weak-willed who will never survive if the odds are against her. 3) Her mom is a lying, pretentious bitch. Would you want that for a mother-in-law? Dunno why, but for me no one beside Doctor Hwang and Woojoo, Soohan and Yebin, Cha Twins and Seunghye seems favorable. I used to like Lee Sooim at first, but she started to appear meddlesome and annoying at some point. I may be the weirdest but I didn\\'t like hyena from the beginning and same for woojoo\\'s mom.. she didn\\'t mind her business and kept on getting on yesuh\\'s mom\\'s nerves. hyena wants revenge but what for? her dad didn\\'t even knew her existence so do his family, she seems so sly I really can\\'t stand her and the way she uses woojoo to get to yesuh really makes me irritated by her. otherwise I looove the twin\\'s mom and can\\'t wait to see her daughter, I think it will be funny with the father. I really like Hye Na.They look cute with Woo Joo❤ I love this drama, but I don\\'t know why I really hate Kim Hye Na. She\\'s so annoying. I think she is gonna be hurting Ye Seo\\'s family. And she looks like have a plan to do a revenge to Ye Seo\\'s family. Oh God, I really really hate her. Very well-made drama I must say, actors may not be A-list but the acting is really realistic, the plot is so interesting and the end of every episodes always make us keep looking forward next week! Gosh this drama is very likely win big in next year awards, mark my word. I got hooked after the first episode however i hated hyena from the start and now I strongly hate her, she’s so annoying she just wants to take revenge and hurt yehsuh and yebin’s family. Like gurl, im getting irritated by her and honestly I hope she doesn’t end up with woojoo. I hope he realizes that she’s not that good of a person and either ends up with no one or yehsuh. If he ends up alone I want yehsuh to end up with one of the twins I hate Yeh Suh\\'s mom, I\\'m grateful because my mom doesn\\'t like her. Success isn\\'t about you passed the best university, but how you can control ur greediness. And don\\'t just look at the result, the process is more important. That\\'s important thing so you can face the reality in life. I like how Woo Joo\\'s mom solve the problem, like first you should be patient and let just the wind blows then if they still stubborn af you should kick them lol. And for Kim teacher, *insert the best insult words*. One of high quality kdrama after Mr. Sunshine. I LOVE IT. I really love this drama. I remember when I was teen. I got scolded very much even my grade is good. I can\\'t play with my friends. All I did is study. I ever took pills (brain nutrition) for final exam. I tried to kill my self because mom treated me like I never did good in anything. Good thing, she changed now. I will recommend this kdrama to her? I really like kim hye na, i hope she will have a happy ending with woo joo This drama is really good!! I really got speechless with the parents in this story (except hwang family and the twin\\'s mother). They treat their children poorly. i dont know why but there are times that i feel annoying with sue lim. but this drama is really good.:) Actually, the drama makes me curious about how parents in Korean educate and treat their children. uhh it so sad look the kids live like that T.T such a great drama!! Awesome drama with great casts and storyline. Hidden mistery, secret and lies, ambition, prestige, wuahh.. those elite and vvip life. As expected, the show is litttt!! So much happening, never a dull moment! Everyone is slaying their roles! I really like Hwang\\'s family.. and i like Kang Ye-Bin and Cha Ki-Joon, i like their character.. Kang Chan-Hee i\\'m here because of you?? oh my gosh. the best ongoing drama. never really seen anything like this one before, so kudos to the writer and might I say the ensemble is brilliant. sky castle fighting!!! 4 episodes and there\\'s not much screen time for the kids except Ye-Seo. I mean I know the main focus is the parents and the main family is Ye Seo\\'s family but I hope to see more of the other kids especially the twins. Daebak episode 4 rating is 7.496%.. i remember episode 1 rating is 1.727%.. increase so much just in 4 episode.. and the screenwriter is Bridal Mask screenwriter.. Can\\'t wait for next week.. Daebak Satirical look at upper middle class seoul society. hahaha....so full of themselves . well executed though,. Like it so far. The adult cast is interesting. I\\'m interested in the high school daughter & sons story hahaha... that smart but bratty girl with the twin boys & newcomer rival boy. Loved episode One. This one I must watch to the end! This kinda reminds me of Queen Of Housewives, which, it was amazing!!!! Hope this too!!! It looks interesting I hope show will have amazing ratings.Cast and plot is exciting Grownups drama!! I\\'m looking forward to seeing this one! The teaser looks promising!!',\n",

       "  'comments': 'Solely because of Chae Seojin. Lee Taeri should be the male lead. So, this drama had potential plot, but not enough character development. They seemed too flat, and not enough individualality. The male lead and the female lead had zero chemistry. You could see the female did but the male actor looked so generic, fake. Maybe it’s his acting skill or he just didn’t know how to act with the actress. Also I wish that SB was more present in the show. Although SB and SJ were basically the same person, SJ made more of an appearance on the show than SB.i hope the writer’s didn’t do that purposely just bcus SB is a big girl And didn’t want her appearing too much in the series. The ending was good, but was too rushed. This drama also was supposed to have 16 eps but only had 12. Sucks though cause maybe just maybe if this drama stayed on for 16 eps we would’ve maybe seen mor chemistry between the main characters.anyways out of 5 stars I give this a 2 stars, why not the 2 star it deserves, wel it’s becus the plot had potential for a good story, but it didn’t fulfill its true potential... People are so hypocritical (complaining about fat shaming and/or beauty standards). Would they date/marry someone they find unattractive (for whatever reason)? Probably not. So why complain and give bad rating when the characters (leads) act according to what they like? OUT OF 5 STARS: 3.5. the drama had a very sweet welcoming message and that is to love yourself before you can truly love others (sounds like recent albums by a popular Korean boy band with exactly seven members???). HOWEVER the main goal of me watching this was to see the chubby girl get the guy. I didn\\'t care too much for Go Woon, in fact Seul Bi was much prettier in my opinion and if she would\\'ve wore something other than her grandmother\\'s table cloths then she could\\'ve rocked the show. the only reason I wouldn\\'t give this a solid 5 stars is because the ending was waayyyyy too open and I didn\\'t get the satisfaction of knowing whether or not they are dating and feels like I wasted 12+hrs of my life waiting for that moment and not even getting it. Do I recommend this? If you\\'ve really just got time to kill then yes. if you have insecurities then double yes. just don\\'t expect too much romance from the main lead couple. I\\'m seriously mad everyone got to do cutesy things in the end except for them >:( >:( >:c What a heart warming drama, the message is so good \"love your self, if you want to be loved\" I love when I watch first episode... its like giving me to believe that fat or ugly girl deserve a love from handsome man... after go woon appear its really disappointed me... but I still believe our hyun woo is not that kind of man... I just watch 2 episode and seriously want to continue next episode... it get me emotional.... anyway I LOVE MORE seul bi than go woon Seulbi\\'s roommate is such a horrible friend, i hate her so much, cant stand her!! The pace of the drama is also so so bad. It\\'s very rushed. The chemistry between the main leads were non existent. Wasted my time with this drama, pointless and messy what happen? Is it really end?, I thought this drama is up to 16 episodes??? why you make it 12episodes?? so bad I think this drama is pretty bad. they announced if there would be 16 episodes, but why did it end in episode 12? the storyline is so rushed. I\\'m happy with the end of the story, but, I can\\'t feel the chemistry between them. resolving conflicts is also very impressed fast and easy as if it could be completed in 1 day even though their conflict about love. Maybe if it\\'s not accelerated, this drama will be even better. rating of 2/5 I started this drama with high hopes and I enjoyed seeing Seul Bi make an impression on her boss and co workers with her artistic talent as a cartoonist. However when Go Woo appears that’s when this story started to go AWOL. I’m frustrated and extremely annoyed and the only reason why I’m still watching is because I like the supporting characters and I want Seul Bi/Go Woon to be outed and to get her comeuppance when her coffee maker disappears and her true self is revealed. the weird of next Monstar, Yoon Seol Chan with Shim Eun Ha,:D:D:D i love watching this drama before Go Woon come out. How Seul bi feels when she admiring writer Im & work with him. here who is the female lead? why more Chae Seo-Jin is playing until episode 6 is still her, the beach rating is small hick2... Hyun wo with sul bi . I want to Hyun woo end up with Seul bi not with Go woon I skipped until Chae Seo Jin appears I love it so much. I remember Japanese drama title switched, one pretty and one ugly and fat. But i love it. Cute, funny and oh fantastic! Pokoknya mah baper akut! The show is disappointing to me so far. The first episode got me hooked so quickly and then it just went down hill from there. I really liked the idea of a chubby female lead but as the show progresses it becomes apparent that she really isn\\'t the lead at all. The last 2 episodes we\\'ve barely gotten a glimpse of her. Appearing mainly at the beginning and end of each episode for like 2 minutes. You know if goo woon keeps appears rather Than seul bi. This seems sarcasm. That the writer keeps use the first female lead who are more fit with standard beauty than the first female lead. In conclusion that the fat and not beauty standard they don\\'t deserve to play role even they are in position as the first female lead. Loving this drama. At first I did not feel like watching, but when I started to watch, am finding it cute. Refreshing plot. seulbi , you\\'re really beautiful! seems like a sweet and fresh drama although the pretty girl is not that pretty i\\'ll give the drama a chance just to see yong joon hyung (i loved him since monstar days) Looks cute:D:) A continuation of moonstar I uncomfortable with this kinds of plot which is objectify the looks. One is pretty, one who not pretty.',\n",

       "  'comments': 'Love this drama. Great chemistry between JSW and LMJ This was another great drama and I\\'m sad to see it go. Great performances especially by Shim Yi-Young, Kong Jung-Hwan, Song Ok-Suk and So E-Hyun. So E Hyun (Cha Soo Hyun) was magnificent!! She stole the show for me personally, but everyone did a great job. She was just phenomenal!! I will definitely check out more of her work!!! SPOILER ALERT-- SPOILER ALERT - I hate what happened to sister in law. She deserved a happy ending after all the pain and suffering she went through with the evil mother in law, not to mention the beatings and abuse from her husband and most of all the pain and loneliness of being separated from her son.. writer why so cruel??? The twist in the story is really upsetting.. i hated it so bad Just got thru ep 32. I don\\'t think Haera is stupid. She just got manipulated by someone disgustingly evil, the mastermind behind the business takeover that won\\'t let anything or anyone get in her or her son\\'s way and will do anything necessary, including murder. I started watching it because the leads are the same from Cunning Single Lady which is really good but I just ended up fast forwarding their scenes mid part of the story. The plot is just so messed up. This drama from the start has got me edging closer to the end of my seat and i dont mean it in a good way, i meant getting closer to switch the TV off! Main characters are pathetically simpleminded and the sub characters are moving to top spot. It took 16 hair pulling episodes to get into a real drama series with a purpose of revenge, redemption and deceit. Really enjoyed episode 17 and 18. As the drama goes on, Goo Haera just ends up as one of those pathetic annoying female leads that u just don\\'t root for in kdrama. And LMJ unsatisfactory performance this time doesn\\'t help that either. Maybe romcoms are more her thing than heavy dramatic ones. I ended up liking Soohyun though, she\\'s smart and elegant. Her angsty backstory with Jennie and Taeoh is interesting and So Yi Hyun just plays her so well. I love all the cast especially the lead stars.... We love your shows in the UnitedStates, in fact we talked about your shows in Facebook .... I am disappointed with Fate and Furies... It drags on like a Turtle...What can be done in the usual 12to 16 episodes is dragged to 40 .!!!!! Reading all these comments here, I guess I\\'m not alone!!!! It is unfair to the most admired Actors that they go endure the boring drama.... It\\'s actually insulting to them.....The Writers should apologize to them .... This drama is so annoying. That Go Hae Ra is so f**** stupid! Tae In Joon is also stupid! I hate Go Hae Ra character so much! I can’t believe i’m Still watching this...lol! I think she should suffer because of her own stupidity until this drama ends! That would be the perfect scene for her coz she deserves it! On the other hand, I am hoping that she could redeem herself in the next coming episodes. I love this main couple but oh my gosh...the frustration watching this drama is real! The plot of this story is so flawed and questionable in most parts. But because you are upset about it, you can\\'t help but continue watching it to see how the conflict of the story will be resolved. @WiL yeah i was frustrated but not anymore, the satisfaction of seeing her break down whe she found out it was the wrong brother charged and seeing Tae Joon go in for 2 years for his stupidity is all kind of refreshing....now we can get on with this drama of deceit and suspence with a rebuilding of romance without the stupid skirt chasing and ignorence to foolish love (now he learnt his lesson) and 2 years should be enough time for Hae Ra to build a solid revenge plan against Tae Jang Ho...if she hasn\\'t WTF has she been doing? cause it seem long for her to take down Tae Joon...lol This Drama Is Too Frustrating but it\\'s good in some ways. People worrying that male lead might lose female lead due to betrayal My personal opinion on how to make this show interesting watch it in faster playback speeds 2x or 3x that way you can virtually increase the quality of the show anyways it really made me like this show after watching at faster speeds. Love the pairing of Lee Min Jung/Joo Sang Wook again in this drama. The last time they were leads in Cunning Single Lady was awesome too. this drama is so f\\'n annoying as hell...Hae-Ra has her reason but going about it the extreme way and without hard evidence too! Tae In-Joon is an abosolute idiot that evidence is slapping his face left-right-center that she using him and still kisses her in the church!!...she leaves and he\\'ll probably still chasing her like a bitch that he is...hes that obsessed with her that hes willing to turn a blind eye to anything she does wrong!!!...6 more episodes left (double episode in one) and i can see Hae-Ra and idiot In-Joon being happy at the end but ill watch this just to see Hae-Ra\\'s face when she finds out that she destroyed/used In-Joons life for absolutely nothing but his true love for her...even tho hes sickening to watch...lol It was only good until ep 8. Right now it is just so boring. The plot is very veryyyyyy slow. And i hate that hae ra is becoming a bad person herself sacrificing in joon. Without checking the facts that it wasnt in joon that hurt her sister. I mean come on the sister isnt a saint herself. He went out with a married man just for the money. Thums down thubs dow thumbs down I’m finding the story and scenes of Soo Hyun and Tae Oh much more interesting than that of Hea Ra and In Joon even though the whole story is intertwined. I’m hoping their story picks up in later episodes as, as of now it’s a little dull and boring. What is the title of the lovely violin melody played from 35:25 through 37:12 of episode 23? The piece has been featured in several previous episodes, yet the musicians and title are difficult to locate. Thanks to the talented artists and composer, the piece is?hauntingly beautiful?. .... it is interesting how many here fans the film character Cha Soo-Hyun - an arrogant careerist, recklessly pursuing his goal, even absolutely uncharacteristic willing to give the kidney to his unwanted daughter - not to help her in healing but just to revenge another Woman (Goo Hae-Ra) ... Love this drama. Wish for happy ending because I hate watching Joo Sang Wook sad ending in Grand Prince.? So E-Hyun is amazing as the antagonist. I hate her one moment, then love her and empathize with her in the next moment. Scenes with her and Oh Jin Tae and Jennie are amazing!! Hope to see more of her as a mom and less as a woman desperate for a man who doesn\\'t want her! So E-hyun is my favorite antagonist as of the moment..Great actress! this drama got interesting (ep 9) sometimes feel sorry for Soo Hyun as shes trying to establish a marriage based on corporate stability, reputation and power (with is not normal to mid class people) but her speech about \"your heart is hers and the rest is mine\" was wicked!!! love how she can grab his balls while letting Hae-Ra only hold his hands!! lol In-Joon didnt see that one coming!!! lol 1. loved the ost What a great story this drama has. I love how Min-Jung portray the character of Hae-ra, it\\'s really convincing. Plus, both leads really have a great chemistry. So far i\\'m enjoying this drama and i\\'m really dying in waiting for the next more episodes. Lee min Jung is Awesome I like this show. Lee Ming Jung/Goo Hae-Ra is a talented and beautiful actress and pairing with Tae In-Joon/Joo Sang Wook is an excellent choice. Both are great actor and actress. Just love the idea of them falling in love. They look good together and a very touching drama. I can\\'t wait to see what happens next. @Miro I really liked Cunning Single Lady so it\\'s nice to see this couple back together!! Drama seems really interesting so far (which is a nice change from many of the dramas out this year) hopefully it continues to peak my interest ^_^ why the next episode is so long to air? Can\\'t wait for it. Please... Does anyone know why episodes 9, 10, 11 and 12 are broadcast until behind per to 14 days? I like Joo Sang Wook . no episode this week? can’t wait anymore please upload fast! T.T Where are episode 9 and 10? Nice story, hope it will go smoothly without any hassle, both lead are the best of the best, hope this will get higher ratings unlike CSL which is underrated but a great drama(so unfair) never even regret watching that! JSW & LMJ are my favorite actors, they have a great chemistry together.....FIGHTING!!! Best Couple! Joo Sang-Wook is a great actor. Recently finished watching him in Grand Prince. This begins quite interestingly. Joo Sang Wook is a great actor. Having enjoyed his work in the \"Grand Prince\" One expects him to outdo his previous performance. In the episodes currently watching he is already getting a little greedy. I\\'m dying with this waiting.... T_T Woww the rating show an increasing number..i guess people started to show some attention now?? Was there dram like this? Heavy roance. Complicated drama ow whealthy family. Like a monster or.. anything suggestion? Help mee... I\\'em so desperate seek nother drama with this genre. ohh love this much. Highly recommended!!! oppah Joo-Sang Wook. All casts are great. I love also the girl Lee Mi-Jung. They\\'re one of my favorite couple. <3 Really love them! one of the best drama Watched the first 4 Episodes, it is an excellent drama, I highly recommend this, amazing chemistry between the two leads, you will not regret watching this, its daebak. I look forward to, that in this drama I will see again starring in together Lee Min-Jung and Joo Sang-Wook. Already in the Cunning Single Lady, they created a great pair. Undoubtedly it will be so now. Finally, the drama with my favorite actors ...:) Woooowww reunion drama between lee min jung and joo sang wook Who\\'s watch CSL again before fates & furies airing? *me* I caaannn\\'tt waaaiittt.

       "  'comments': 'it\\'s thrilling but too much flashbacks making me confused on which scene took place first. storyline sometimes becoming so slow and that\\'s kinda annoying. i rate this drama 7/10 . This drama was so thrilling and amazing to watch. Hyun Bin portrayed the character sooo well. I love him! I\\'m such a fan. But, I\\'m not satisfied with the ending, hiks... Really really need season 2... One of my fave drama even I’m not Satisfied with the ending, but still highly recommended to watch! I hope this incredible series will have a season 2.. Daebakkkkk!! Thumbs up 100x; Wow....Finally finished this amazing drama (and yes tuned in because of Hyun Bin)...and he did not disappoint. This drama is truly exciting, intense and thrilling right through from beginning to end. It was on netflix so I was like \"okay I\\'m bored so let\\'s try it\" so I clicked and started to watch and I see the back of someone talking and his voice is familiar and then I see his face and I\\'m like \"WAIT WHATTTT\" One of the most brilliant drama I\\'ve seen so far, Highly recommended! The story was written so inventively and intellectually. Each episodes are anticipated. The actors gave justice of what the characters need. Cinematography are A+. They ended it well by hanging the viewers with \" so Jin woo is in Instance Dungeon?\" Something has excited me after a long time! I stumbled on it, courtesy of Netflix. I think I like everything about it - the music, the beautiful characters, the cinematography, and the Game itself. VERY INTRIGUING! Can\\'t afford to missed not even a second or u will lose the whole story. But one thing.. why does every time Park Shin Hye being kissed (1st kiss episode 11) she looked like in terrible pain? Same goes with her previous drama in 2013. She is beautiful but cries a lot! LOL @ coconut i thought i was the only one thinking of w while watching, i did not even care for the little romance that was there, i just really like the plot and the story is awesome This drama takes gaming to a whole different level! At first it was hard to get into because of the fight scenes that no one but the player could see but each episode only gets better and better. Hyun-Bin made it real. The ending suggests the game goes on as the main characters meet where only the lens can see. I loved this. Unfortunately, Korean dramas have a problem with telling a story in a straight timeline and keep doing flashbacks which drive me nuts, and I will usually fast-forward through them. However, doing that in this drama, you miss a lot of info...they are more like \"back stories\" than \"flashbacks\" in most cases. Hyun Bin was wonderful. PSH role was just to cry, I guess. When she wasn\\'t crying, she was staring into space. Many people did not like the ending...because they did not get it! Listen very carefully to the brother\\'s conversation with the programmer in the last ep and how he got out. You will then see that the ending is actually quite happy, if not totally complete. Some people are not happy unless every detail is completely laid out for them so they don\\'t have to think. Definitely different subject matter that initially I just wasn\\'t into it but it gets really good the more you watch. It takes game playing to a whole other level. Hyun-Bin was super cool and made it real. The ending is a cliff hanger but I liked it. It suggests another world could exist where you could connect and be together. The intro picture resembles the Mecca Kaaba black stone ...did any body else think that? I was a bit disappointed with the ending. I think this needs a season 2. Jaebalyo.. Love this drama.. seriously Hyun Bin never disappoints me!! ♡♡ Although the ending was not the way i wanted, but deep inside i knew it would end up like this haha.. but i loved it to an extent where i couldnt sleep and wanted to know what ll happen next.. God! i was awake till 3am and watching it, then i realised tat i have work the next day, so slept.. Thanq for the new drama Hyun Bin (but Secret Garden will always be my favorite) and Park Shin Hye executed her job well (though her role was less) Aaaa..i get it. Though the ending was a bit of dissapointment but i still enjoy watching this drama. Throughout the drama i thought this somewhat resembled W, kind of, and later i found this was written by the same writer. So many heartbreaking moments (spoiler alerts), the one that broke my heart the most is when secretary seo died T.T, and jin woo could only watching him get stabbed from the train, the moment he came back to help jinwoo, seeing jinwoo in tears watching him reappear broke my heart. Wuwuw. This drama may not be anyone cup of tea, but it is for me. I still enjoy this drama and hoping for season 2. Hee. Great drama. Not the best but good enough. Why many ppl don\\'t like this drama? While watching this, you have to figure out and pay much attention to the details. Otherwise, you will think that this drama lacks of explanation and has many unanswered questions. And the ending matches well with the genre of the drama. It is actually a happy ending. This drama is beautiful and interesting but I stop watching in the middle because I see that this hasn\\'t no clear ending and I know most of the Korean dramas have no part 2.. ..so please when you will do again part 2 it should clear all some errors...thank you I didn\\'t think i\\'d end up not liking this but I did. I actually felt bored watching this series. Park Shin Hye\\'s character actually ended up boring me the most. I felt like she barely did anything except cry. ? I like this drama, it wasn\\'t rated excellent but I like it. If you\\'re smart enough then details in the story will answer all the question behind it. Watching up until episode 5 isn\\'t enough to evaluate this drama.. I’ve only watched 5 episodes and i think this is as far as i can go. The idea was promising, i never thought it would end up to be this baaaddddd! Why? Okay here’s why wait.... Duo Director and Writer are good. Just like their previous work, the story has many twist amd unpredictable what happen in the next eps. Even sometimes you\\'ll disappointed later because it\\'s just a bait. IDK because it\\'s on cable TV, too much unrelated product replacement scene. The ending also as expected and unexpected typical western series on Netflix. They need to make another sequel, there are many story that they can tell. Starting from Jinu, sub Company for Sejoo, and the next president for J-One. Also about cheater of the game or another company or even conflict between Sejoo\\'s company with new J-One. We want more scene of Hyun Bin with Shin Hye... I\\'m kinda disappointed. Innovative plot but sometimes it\\'s not logic at all and lacks explanation. The story progression was really slow and there was too much product placement that doesn\\'t the context on plot. The writer teases us with something and then reveals its nothing after. The ending was not satisfiying at all. Spoiler free review~~ This has been by far MY FAVORITE MOST DRAMA. It avoids cliche kdrama scenes. And what a total banger fashion sense both the lead characters have. I have absolutely LOVED every episode of it especially Min-joo and Jinwoo scenes. Each and every actor did total justice to the role. It’s a great move for me to let the drama come to an end before watching it. Each episode was so thrilling that I want to finish the drama as soon as possible without sleeping. Spoiler alert! Like some other viewers, I felt cheated by the ending. The premise -- a variation on the Frankenstein story, where a human creation takes on its own monstrous life beyond the creator\\'s control -- was pretty interesting, so I stuck with the series. The lead actors were excellent. Grenada as one of the settings added interest. But gee whiz, what a let down at the end... I happen to be a Christian, but I felt like the implied \"divine intervention\" ending with heavy-handed Christ symbolism was clunky and forced, and did not deliver emotional justice to the story. If they want to write a Christian-themed story, then shouldn\\'t that be woven into the whole series, instead of suddenly tacked on at the end? Of course, the fact that the romantic couple were left in a state of limbo at the end felt like an awful disappointment. If it\\'s a romance, gift it a romantic ending. If it\\'s tragedy, a tragic ending. But what the heck was that??? Waiting for episode 17... season 2? Hope so! It can’t end like that in epi 16!! Great storyline.. annoyed it dragged on in some parts. will there be another season? if it the end i am so disappointed!! the show was amazing and the ending was the worst hope there will be another season and this is not the end because damn i love it but i hate how it ended!:( If youre into Netflix youll probably love this kind of serries.I super love it!!! Good story. But bad production. The characters are mess, same case with the plot. Worst drama\\'s ending i\\'ve ever watched. Sorry Everything is perfect anout this drama. The cast, the setup, the concept!! The graphic is crazy top notch and boy, the ending is. A perfect setup for a next season. Im telling you, the drama is perfect. Why is everybody hating on this show? It really boggles my mind. I was afraid to watch it because of all the crazy negative hating comments everywhere. But then i read here someone said to just watch it and judge it yourself... so i did. And whoa, i was hooked from the first episode! I was worried at every episode for the drama to turn to the “stupid-horrible-gigantically dissapointing-drama” but it never came. I love every seconds of the drama. I never really liked park shin hye but this drama makes me feeling butterflies for her and hyun bin. Really. Watch it. For the first time, i dont hate the open ending. It’s just perfect, really. I cannot recommend it enough. The drama is perfect! If ever there is second season, i’ll be the happiest fangirl. Fell in love with Hyun Bin\\'s smile all over again!!! Love Chan-Yeol since Roommate and his acting here is really good. Park Shin Hye\\'s simply beautiful. Min Joo is very cute. Love everything about this drama except I would have loved to see JW and JH gets reunited in the finale. Well, hope there\\'s season 2. The only reason to watch this drama is because of Hyun Bin and Park Shin Hye pairing. Otherwise, the story is crappy and ridiculous. I can\\'t believe this is from the same writer that made the great dramas Nine Times Travel and Qeen In Hyuns Man. Huyn Bin was a superstar in this series. Outstanding performances in every episode. JW is trapped in the game, but Huyn Bin is not so go find your love and happiness. All the very best to you. Please give us more hyun bin and park shin hye. A lot of us, if not all of us, need more of them!!! I have never craved such a couple like them before. We need more of them together. A season 2 with same cast or extra episodes. Omg I\\'m just dying without them. Please make season two with a same cast. Fantastic drama!! What a concept!! Love hyu bin. Please do more drama. Love the chemistry between park and hyun. All charactrs played really well. Mix Feeling about this drama, when i knew the writer i had a feeling that this will end up like W, the pace is slow, story become darker and darker. I mean, i want the main cast can be happy once. I still watch it until the end thanks to Hyun Bin! Especially his bangs! hahaha, he ages like fine wine! Oppa please take a better project next time! This drama is very exciting and thrilling! ~SPOILER ALERT~ In an effort to maybe show what I understood about the drama, I\\'ll put what I think is going on,since I see questions from others. SPOILER ALERT~ This was enjoyable. As a drama, it held my attention and I wanted to see what would happen and what was happening. It was good to see Hyun Bin doing something new and different, it\\'s just what he needed. He did a great job! Park Shin-Hye kinda was just a supporting role in this, which is fine, but it was nice to see her playing an adult. My guess is if there is a sequel, the main cast like HB and PSH will no longer be there...all they need to do is some explanation and start with a new and better improved game... I\\'ll still be supporting it as long as the cast is not too bad. Hiyas to all who have taken part in the production of this drama.. And to all us fans! ^_^ Not satisfied with the ending...please make the ending more interesting...i can\\'t get over into this! Very dissappointed with the ending! Jin woo/zinu please have a good life! I love this drama!!! Season 2 please!!! Because jin woo is still alive. Omg this drama was stuck in my head. I know that hyun bin never let me down with his acting. And i want give you some advice, please make park shin hye be more fun, smart and usefull girl. I feel she\\'s too weak, fraigle and like a fool girl. Please make season 2!!! I loved the drama, It doesn\\'t matter about the commercials break. But the one I really hate is the ending. I knew, I\\'m not the script writer but, why almost all korean drama had absurd ending, like give me the last episode and I would make it sad or happy like actually life. huft >.<, but i give you two my thumbs not four because you had the unpredictable story about game!!. actually all I predict when watching drama or movies is excellent. haahaha I don\\'t know how i\\'m feeling after watching SJJ drama. PSH aka jungheejoo character is the most uselles female char i\\'ve ever seen on kdrama. SPOILER ALERT! The ending was dissapointed.. Why??? I love this drama.. So much,, please season 2....,,, why the hell the ending hanging like that? I mean, i love this drama so much! The story is original and unique and also the effects are so awesome! I appreciated and respect the staff & director-nim & writer-nim & actors hardwork. But, the ending leaves me hanging. like, what? This is the end? Spoilers Season 2 jebal!?? i think there is season 2 weeeee Yes! One of my favorite dramas! Ummm, that was until the last episode. Did someone forget to write an ending? I\\'ve learned that Kdramas tend to leave you hanging. Even hoping for a second season. This one just shoved us off the cliff, with no bottom in sight. It could have ended better. Didn\\'t even have to be a happy ending, just an ending would have sufficed. The cast is great. I think they all worked well together. They made their characters believable. The characters deserve to have their parts played out a bit more. SPOILERS I have similar comment below regarding the many loop holes and very disappointing ending... In order to make up for these flaws, there should be a sequel to explain such loop holes exist when we the viewers would look so ignorant and naive. Finally, PSH should meet Hyun Bin but the last scene was so dark and may not happen along the way where PSH was so desperate to look for Hyun Bin. At least meeting betweeh PSH and Hyun Bin should be regarded as important because that\\'s what Hyun Bin promised. IF so the Loopholes will be negligible and will bring the whole episode worth watching. I hope sequel will be stored and considered and I am sure this drama\\'s rating will soar up ....believe me...... I absolutely loved this show. Is there another season! If not the ending was disappointing! I did enjoyed the drama but honestly I too felt like something was missing WTH with the ending of this drama? I’m so disappointed. ==‘ I don’t like the ending at all. this is scifi beyond scifi Spoilers! This was the absolute worst drama I’ve ever seen. Did anyone even pay attention to details? There so many rules to the game, npc can’t go past doors- but yet they can pop up in rooms?... never explained how exactly they got stuck in the game? Did the contact lenses have a defect?? How did they die in real life? When the guns and swords are fake. How come no one else experienced what jin woo and the others experienced? They were testers in the beginning too. You have to be level 5 to speak with Emma but hee ju talked to her just fine at level 1? Too many rules and too many loop holes. I do hope they make a sequel to explain the Chicken many many missing pieces that left some of us in disbelief. The instance dungeon required a quest, to open and let you out like SeJu planned- IF Jin woo was in there how did he get out? Makes no sense, every epidsode was 20 mins of new content and 40 mins of flashbacks that took you back too far into a scene you had already rewatched. I’d rather you spend your time watching something else. It was a original ending and not a typical ending... but something was missing for me. So I just watch the end of epsiode 11 to satisfy my fantasy.? This drama was amazing. We just watched the last episode and it has blown me away. However, I am not satisfied with the ending although it was an open ending--- I agree with many people.. We have given a lot of our time and have all fallen in love with this drama. Hyun bin and park shin hye did an amazing job as well as all the casts. I cannot keep thinking about psy and hyun bin\\'s chemistry. It was electrofying. Someone get these two a second season AND pair them up again in another drama!!!! Gauranteed, if you do this, your ratings will be high! For the past 2 months, I have been excited.. Sad.. Worried.. Devestated.. And now, completely crushed and just got done crying and almost throwing up. We need more!!!! Feed our addiction❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ Please!! 200% agreed with zeroalpha. however if there gonna be another season than i can have patience and will wait for it quietly. if not, than it was a waste of my time. I agree with @bad that is drama is a waste of a good idea, of usually excellent actors and of scarce money. Little bit dissapointed with the ending but it was a good drama hopefully will be a continuation story of it. I can\\'t wait to watch it, Hyun Bin....i love u, u r such a lovely man...wait for the next alhambra with u??? This is prequel story of Next game A good story but unfinished. Loved It!! just wanna share my thought about the ending....... Sorry this maybe a spoiler. The ending is quite clear for me, he become master and went into temporary dungeon, like what happened with SeJoo (while he went missing)  After watching the last episode my condition is similar to Mr.Park while seeing those three white ashes... Should be called Flashbacks of Alahambra. This could have been a 5 episode show if they had cut out the flashbacks witch took up 50 percent of every episode and if they cut out the useless x wives. Show was a great idea with bad follow through. Plot holes and unanswered questions. The freaking genius game maker shows up and fixes nothing. One year later he changes his mind about the star being dead or not because it took him one year to think. He acts like a brainless moron. It\\'s just so dumb. The ending was the worst ending in history. I was waiting for this drama with lots of hope.But totally disappointed with the ending.Another example of a very \\'bad ending\\' drama.How can they do this with the audience????? The ending is very unpleasant to viewers..we were left hanging.. im hoping for a sequel Rating: 100/100. Yeah this is not ending but the new beginning for season 2 lmao I agree with Tin, if Jinwoo,Hyungseok, Prof Cha, and Junghoon is bug, then Marco and Sejoo should be consider as bug too. And the Most Bad Ending of 2018-2019 goes to.. Confusing of the Alhambra. The best thing on this drama are the actors only. Drama itself is a mess, I enjoyed it at first but at the finishing is just 100% nonsense. You better get that season 2 TvN!? This drama disappointed me so much? it had so much potential it’s such a shame the writer dicided to end it like that? rating 4/10: Expected the expected, 7/10. It\\'s sad to say but only die-hard fans would still give high remarks for this drama. Everything in this drama were so good,, need more episode for exact ending for jin woo and hee joo. Sequel, anyone? What happened at the end? There was no ending! Nothing finished and everything left with no ending? Very, very strange K drama. They should make more and sort out the ending. This is not funny? Please say SPOILERS! I loved this drama until the ending, what a shambles, absolutely gutted and one of the worst ever endings of any K Drama ever! So many plot holes left uncovered and not finished and WTF was that right at the end? Was he alive or a NPC or what. I\\'m sorry the producers should get back to work and sort this mess out no way should a person use up 16 hours of your life to be left hanging like that, disgrace! Sort it out PLEASE! Please! Make a special episode to be the finishing to this story.. Please im beg to you?.. The ending was not the expecting one.. It should be the nice ending???? I\\'m rather disappointed with the end of this drama. Nevertheless, I\\'m still thinking positively that Song Jae Jung wants to be more realistic here than his \"W\" drama. i don\\'t expect the ending will be like that.. if there is a petition making part 2 I will fill the petition. Sunggu we are disappointed with Open Ending. whereas the theme raised by this drama is a brilliant idea. it\\'s true that all started and based on Jung Se-Joo. but Yoo Jin-Woo also plays a very important role here. Same feeling here? hanging.. SPOILERS! Disappointed with the unclear ending...:( This show was awesome and very well written until the last episode. It got my attention here in the US. And, I had personally recommended this show to my friends & gotten them into the show. That\\'s can\\'t be the end ~~~~ Please give us an special episode or season 2! I am completely sad and ugly cried over this drama. We need another romantic drama with park shin hye and hyun bin!! Best chemistry ever❤️ Ending is not tasty. It\\'s a good drama, but Ep 16 is a spoiler. I was always on heels to watch the episodes. However this time i was regretting for watching the last episode. No, i shouldn\\'t have. I feel sorry for Hee-ju and Jin Woo. I expected a sad ending. But an open ending was not appropriate for this drama. It was pretty hard to expect a happy ending after a very long and painful journey of Jin-Woo! If there was not romance or love confession then an open ending will be completely ok! No clarity at the end. So any questions left with the viewers. These kind of endings should have put in ep 15 to create suspense. But this looks like something is still left. I love PSH and she is really one of the best actress in SK. I started watching this drama bcoz of PSH and also ended up as a fan of Hyun Bin. He is a matured looking guy unlike few other actors who always look cute and childish. Please run ep 17 and end this clearly. Rating: 7/10 I thought it really haven\\'t end yet. But it just have 16 episodes. So yes the ending is lil bit disappointed. It have hang ending. Why the writer didn\\'t make it clear? 95% comments are dissapointed with the last episode. Next time i dont want watch k-drama with the writer as same as in MOA. why writer-nim:( SPOILERS!!! Hyun Bin is impressive in this drama..... Even its not good ending. This drama is cool. I love this drama from beginning to end. It\\'s not a fairy tale story so i didnt expect the ending to be such as one. I\\'m fine with the ending being open ended. Its ok not to spoon fed us like what other viewers would have wanted. With the story\\'s ending, we are left with possibilities. For me, the writer has tied up loose ends very well and has given justice to the characters. Till the end, our main characters stick to their strength. I can live with that. I don\\'t mind a bad ending, but at least Writer should explain clearly What\\'s plot all about to do I was amazed at the entertainment value of this drama. The story was so refreshing and the cinematography so beautiful. I was hooked after the first 2 episodes and watched each episode at least twice to catch the subtitles and acting. Seeing how the story unfolded was such a joy ride. Im enjoying this drama ep 1-15..but last ep make me down, unexpected Another disappointed viewer. Really? Are you making a sequel? Most stupid ending. It went from 5 stars to 1 I’m usually disappointed with the ending in Kdrama so I was ready for a sucky ending. What a drama! Unpredictable to the end in so many aspects. The adrenaline rush was true to the end. However, the ending in the last 50 seconds of ep 16 leaves you unsatisfied more than you can imagine. I need to fangirl because the end was unjustified. I\\'m hoping there is a S2 , a highly unlikely possibility. But they have the plot and enough mysteries of unravel. Don\\'t let the ending discourage you from watching this glorious drama with PSH in it. What a drama! Unpredictable to the end in so many aspects. The adrenaline rush was true to the end.

Waiting for the special episode!! It can\\'t be end like this. I\\'m actually disappointed. The ending just doesn\\'t sit well with my logical reasoning. I was hooked from episode 1 until the very end. Who doesn’t love a happy ending and this one was no exception just not the usual happy ending that we’re use to seeing. Highly recommend this drama. It was intense and kept me interested week after week. Hyun Bin protrayed his character so perfectly. He was amazing along with Park Shin Hye...amazing chemistry! The entire cast all did a phenomenal job! Will definitely miss this drama!  SPOILERS~~ I loved the drama so much but after the 12th episode it just went down...I watched the finale like two hours ago and I still can\\'t get over it...not even one scene together! The creators could at least give them another two minutes to actually meet! or just to close it up!! I am so confused right now...is he trapped in the game?? agggggggrrrrrr, I CAN\\'T! why you have to make park shin hye crying over time sorry to say that. i was so disappointed for the last episode:( Very disappointing. What a waste of good resources. Very poor writing, too many loose ends, the dialogues were stale, there was simply no flow to the storyline. Directing also very poor. It was painfully slow and the ending smack clearly of either the writer running out of ideas or that saving the story for a sequel, which if there is one I would not be wasting my time to watch it. It is a shame as the basis of the story is good, even the plot would have worked had the writing been better. One of the worse k-drama I have watched ( I have watched quite a lot). The actors/actresses did their level best to make something of the poor script, the main character spending endless time fighting mostly alone like madman which I feel totally unnecessary to move the story forward, and did little to develop the character interaction with other characters. The main female character was woefully left to do nothing much but a cry baby, absolutely waste of her talent as a brilliant actress. All in all very disappointing. The ending in a poster and trailer chcek again I loved the drama but this was the worst final episode and ending I have ever seen. I will not say much because I don’t want to spoil it for others but what where the writers thinking? Bad, bad, bad choices for last episode. So disappointed! Everything was great, except the ending In my opinion, I really enjoyed this drama!!! Despite the ending not being your typical kdrama ending, I believe it was crucial in completing the series. This drama revolved around the gameplay of AR experience mixed with reality. They stayed true to their concept of being enslaved to the game and gave respect where it was due. Not everything has to be spelled out for people to understand why things really happened when it did. Cheesy ending, could’ve added more to wrap this up. How come it ended just like that:( i am not sure whether yoo jin woo alives or not. Becasue in the last scene, it\\'s look like he used the same clothes like when he was deleting the bug at the church. Why people always complain the ending of drama?...Ending is quite tragic but good. This types of genre always have open ending. viewers who wants lead to get married and live happily ever after type ending in fantasy drama should not even start from beginning... I don\\'t understands about game. But I enjoyed this drama because of the actors. But right after seeing the ending scene, whoaa it\\'s that really an ending??? Disappointed? Yes! So there\\'s no action from Se Ju to fixing the game\\'s error or something? Memories of Alhambra, I hope the writer fixing this storyline into a special episodes. I do not hope for season to. Just make clear the story into special episode. Khamsahamnida. Unexplained plot holes and inconsistent storyline. Most importantly, memories of the Alhambra - what and where is the Alhambra? The story line was great... The endings are tragic but cool... Memories of Alhambra - So disappointed! It was a risky watch from the beginning, but I considered watching it because I am a fan of Park Shin Hye, and Hyun Bin. They had great chemistry, and their work is always outstanding. The other actors and crew also did an amazing job. Although, the story was unique and creative, in my opinion it was not very good. There was very little hope for the characters, so sad. I wish the writer\\'s creativity had been more extensive. A very shabby ending. Oh well! Good seeing Park Shin Hye, and Hyun Bin, they did an amazing job. Waste of my time.. The lamest ending ever...if not for Hyun bin and park shin hye outstanding performance..I wouldn\\'t watched this drama.. Great actors pairing but worst script writer.. Waste my time for watching this drama. Thanks for the ending:) SPOILERS Oh gosh this drama is lame!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This drama is a video game. The video game is your basic kill to level up game so guys will love this drama, but take the video game away and you have the most basic romance and conflict you\\'ll ever find in a drama. Just basic. Characters have strong reactions and emotions to things and events that in no way warrant such strong reactions. The writer could\\'ve added way more texture to the non-videogame portion of this drama. I would\\'ve tolerated the countless action scenes more if the non-video aspect of this drama had.. well anything. please get married hyun bin and son ye jin so perfect I felt from episode 2 that writer Song Jae-Jung was making a social comment about all the ultra-violent simulated war games people are playing at home, on their smart phones, at the game parlors, and their emotional disassociation from what they are actually doing - killing and mayhem. Are you really suppose to rejoice when you level up by smashing up people? In these games - sure - you\\'re almost being mentally trained to rejoice - but what happens if the game goes wrong, and you really do end up killing - or know that you can be killed if you don\\'t? Will you rejoice then - or become a cold killer like Jin Woo to survive? I like the chemistry of the lead actor and actress, they don\\'t need to have overdo skinship or kisses like some of the other dramas. And all the supporting actors/actresses are well played as well. Well done to the crews of MOA. I am completely obsessed over hyun bin and park shin hye!! What a great drama! My fiancé and I can\\'t wait for the episodes to come out and we plan a date night during the week to watch the episodes every week. I am so sad it\\'s ending? Storyline is so unique and keeps us all entertained. That\\'s why we watch it, Right?! Storyline is not predictable at all. I see a lot of negative reviews but some people just can\\'t be satisfied no matter how the drama goes. They put a lot of work into this drama and it\\'s damn good! Really good! Definitely one of the best I\\'ve seen and I\\'ve seen a lot!! the drama is good although it has a lot of plot holes. but what really bothers me is the character of main lead actress, all she\\'s doing is crying over him, she\\'s useless Hyun Bin is hot and its all that matters.? What a game error killed four people already! This drama save 2018 - Congratulations for this unique and new concept , make k drama in new level. I love from now Hyun Bin and Park Shin He. Hyun Bin makes me forget Ji Chang Wook Hahaha I find the story to be very strange. Nobody in park shin hye\\'s household is worried or bothered to give police complaint when a 17 year old boy disappeared for one whole year. All are going about their life very normally. Park shin hye is crying all the time for her boyfriend, but not her brother who was with her for 17 years. In the 14th episode hyun bin lost his phone and park shin hye gave her phone to him. Very next day morning she has a new phone receiving call from Hyun bin\\'s old phone number. She does not seem to have any better business than trailing him all the time or crying. Yoora was unsteady on her feet when she reached police station. But, within a short time she is completely sober and very steady. The lapses in direction is there everywhere. Totally disappointing. idk man...i just dont get why yall are being so negative....yes i agree that there are a lot of scene that i just skip but i dont skip the fighting and action scenes i personally love it...but i also do think that this drama could\\'ve been better... maybe if it was 12 episodes only...and perhaps its a netflix original thats why its not so good??? idk i feel like anything netflix original is actually not that great....but nonetheless its a great drama and im living for the cast... This show is so slow, I mean people died and stuff... But even so, I feel like I\\'m still in the same spot... it\\'s like I blinked and its now the last week of the show... Hyun-Bin oppa did everytyhing to find Cy when Cy was \"na nana nana na nana nana oh oh it\\'s the LOVE SHOT\" Cannot wait for the next episode!!! same as W drama, they had interesting concept. but the story too slow. too much storytelling and flashback, it\\'s kinda boring.:( Really a good one. I am hooked to this new concept. Love my favorites All time Hyun Bin and Park Shin. I wd hv played this game of it was for real? good work everyone and an excellent new concept Love this show. Unique concept, good acting. Chemistry of Jin Woo and Hee Joo is very impressive. Storyline flows fluidly, smoothly. Elements of action, drama, romance and suspense are presentWant to watch them in new series please. Highly recommended. What a show One of Best drama i\\'ve matched. Superb Acting and plot. Good job Very good!! I love you hyun bin! So... some really strongly negative comments here... for one very well executed drama. This is a very high budget drama with highly regarded actors that lacks a good script. After wasting resources on the wrong things, the Director and the Screenwriter are by now struggling to do anything interesting. I watch it on Netflix. Good job everyone , this drama is beyond my excpectations. Especially for a non Hollywood series. The plot, the making, the acting are both very good . I find the main actor very well in his role on all points. Same for the actress. The koreans seems go beyond the Hollywood actors . Drama highly recommended This is the best K drama 2018,superb acting skills, specially main actor,very talented,hope he will get an award I want to watch this so bad, two more weeks until the last episode T_T The story line is very nice, the actor and actress also do such a great job. The locations for this drama is awesome and unique too. This is my first time watching Hyun Bin and Shin Hye acting and I love it. I\\'ve just realised that this drama is also from the same writer of Queen In Hyun\\'s man and 9 time travel which are my fav kdrama. Really looking forward for more drama from this writer. I love it! With every episode I’m more fascinated over the ideas of this series 10 from 10 from me The way the writers have solved the mystery of the major error origin, is absolutely brilliant! I\\'m relieved they choose this route,and impressed with their thinking. This show has made a great twist, Hyun Bin\\'s character is redeemed in the eyes of those closest. I am looking forward to how they\\'ll correct misunderstanding of the public. The game repair or safty upgrade will be interesting as well. Finding lil bro, I can hardly wait for. @BK @wasabi My thoughts exactly. I\\'m glad to see some same honest opinions (I have bad grammar to express them constructively hehe). The only thing that kept me watching it were both Se ju\\'s outcome and Granada, nothing else. I also agree that it could\\'ve been more magical and mysterious at the same time. The concept is there, it\\'s obviously written in their title opening footage. I guess the budget alone for taping overseas costed them greatly enough that made them unable to execute as planned. (But I really hate the CGI plus the battles, reminded me of watching the local nighttime sci-fi tv shows when I was a kid lol) I\\'m a Hyun Bin fan and I like Park Shin Hye they truly are brilliant actors and sexy too. I like this series, I\\'m not sure of the ending but I truly hope there\\'s a twist in the plot something no one expected. I agree with @BK\\'s comments below. I love so much this drama . I give it 10/10 . I like particularly Hyun Bin\\'s acting. I missed him since Secret garden . He is the best actor in Korea for me The thing that I love the most about this drama is the pairing between Park Shin Hye and Hyun Bin.. the things that I hate about this drama is the constant sword fighting (too repetitive) and the fact that Secretary Seo died in the game. its a dull drama with no chemistry because the romance doesn\\'t suit the actual plot i\\'m only watching to know how it\\'ll end but it is a very pretty drama... Sadly, this is yet another high budget drama with great casting, beautiful shooting locations, cinematography and decent special effects but nothing else. Directing is weak, writing is weak, story is... well there is barely a story really. I\\'m only watching to find out what the heck happened to Se Ju, that\\'s it and even that is tiring. Everything else is rather pointless, including the \"romance\". It\\'s an okay watch since there is nothing else on now but this drama is for video game and anime fans and even then, those stories would probably be better than this one. I love this drama,story is unique and the cast are amazing..thank you tvn. Absolutely captivating: sci fi, thriller, friendship and love. Great actors. I\\'m from Europe and I am mesmerized by this korean drama. \"Not bad\" drama (7/10, spoiler-free review) So I\\'ve searched this because I wanted to know what the ratings was in Korea because this drama is absolutely gold for me. I\\'m surprised though that there are some comments that have a negative view on this drama (we cant please everyone can we?) I think this drama is well written and not lazy unlike what the other comments stated. I think Granada was beautifully pictured and was entailled in the story as necessarily as it could be. This is a topnotch drama right here, honestly I haven\\'t even finished Golbin after these years but this drama I\\'ve anticipated in Netflix every week. It such a compelling drama because you feel for Hyun Bin\\'s character and get invested into other characters too and honestly this drama will wreck you emotionally. Episode 12 as of the moment and I can\\'t wait for more. Thank you TvN for this wonderful and brilliant release. Good job!!! The plot is interesting and each episode is thrilling. Also, Hyun Bin and Park Shin Hye sure has good chemistry and while some are saying the placement of the romantic scenes are off, I disagree. They\\'ve been planting everything since episode 1. And to me, the timing is perfect. Just I really hope the last four episodes will justify everything that has lead to all the heartbreaking scenes:( I just watched ep 1 & half of ep 2. It\\'s tiring. Hyun Bin\\'s acting so awesome as usual. Park shin hye acting is average as usual too. The story is not the typical drama that I addicted. So I left it till no more another interesting drama to be watched Although I don’t usually post reviews no matter how good or bad a show may be... I just really wanted to get this off my chest about this particular drama because I feel like it had so much potential but failed to meet expectations. [spoilers ahead] I\\'m going to miss this drama. Hyun Bin converted fan....  Such a good chemistry between leads actors..both great actor and the sweets kiss scene tho..wow..PSH really reciprocate to Hyun Bin kiss it\\'s really mesmerizing...make it really beautiful to watch.. This is my first time that i watched hyun bin drama but he was really awesome and good actor. They have a good chemistry with Unnie shin hye! I\\'m really ecxcited how it\\'s end an their love story❤❤❤❤❤ fighting! Am going too miss it when it ends???? im affraid if this drama get final plot twist = secretary, see jo, and mr.cha was \"trapped\" in game world:| so jin woo and all try to escape them:| i had been watching this drama until Ep 12. @dodo I like Hyun Bin, this is first Korean TV drama I am watching. Nice & exciting. One of the best kdrama.. I love hyun bin since then, and j love the way he choose his dramas. Hyun bin is one of the korean actors i love and shin hye is also on of the kdrama actress that i like. Some cannot understand the story because they are not upto what will possibly happen to our future.. Love the graphics and the editing and most especially that feeling for hyun bin and shin hye... love you bother One of the best dramas! I miss the secretary so much.. tester103 so noob One of the best k drama so far, i like how different it is than other drama.. my new fav after goblin and kill me heal me, i love the casts, i love the plot, i love the editing, all i can i love everything about moa. i understand why some couldnt agree with the idea of the story. this is because some people cannot accept changes, and some people dont prefer something that dont make sense after all, but as a developer myself, i understand that this kind of \"craziness\" can occur somehow beyond our imagination and expectation. i also developed ar/vr project, i guess this is why i can relate my self to this kind of genre. sometimes its good to be different. many congrats to the writer, producer, staff and all the casts for different yet interesting k drama. Big love from Brunei ♡ Best kdrama with different concept. I love everything about it. Always can’t wait for the next episode. Too sad and shocked when Jin Woo secretary died?☹️? I\\'m 100% with you, @Mouna Ahmed!! Guys, write what you want. Say what you want. ME, i officially declare that this drama is the best of all drama. Sorry but I will not waste my time saying why. I have an episode to watch. Peace for all I love park shin hye. But sorry to say... Her character in here is just useless, not strong, and not really have an impact to the her brother mystery.. Love episode 11 they are so cute during kissing scene, any chance they will together again... @dodo sorry my english isn\\'t good but i\\'ll try to explain. on ep 10 se ju isn\\'t really comeback. when he standing right infront the door, that just in hee ju\\'s dream. Great drama. For me, crying Shin Hye is make sense because she\\'s haunted by the fear of loosing her brother. It\\'s highly imaginative drama, I\\'m not looking forward something real and make senses. It\\'s enough to be just entertaining and thrilling like horror movies. And i enjoy every minute of it. I\\'m not bored by Shin Hye playing memories of Alhambra, it\\'s a beautiful song! Drama doesn’t make sense? Love this kdrama so much! I really like this drama. Different concept. I really surprised when I am watching this drama. This all the concepts must be came out from a one person. Like jk rowlling he also have a different way of thinking.They use lot of technology to make the senes in the game. So different from usual kdramas. Really unique. Great work Great concept but the plot moves too slow. Not my cup of tea i love you my queen psh. this drama is amazing, and i\\'m in love again with Hyun Bin after Secret Garden.. So far, i hate why the main female character didn\\'t have any big influence to the story, just cryin\\' and nursing the main role. I don\\'t understand why some people are not liking this kdrama?! As a person who watched at least a thousand kdramas, this one really stands out to me! The plot makes sense and it\\'s very intriguing! And the fighting may seem repetative, but at least it\\'s not full of stupid repetative romance. The balance between romance and actions is perfect. The idea and plot of the kdrama is also very unique and different. If you don\\'t like thrillers than this drama is definitly not for you. Yah, it sucks that the secretary dies, but tbh I\\'m tired of all kdramas ending with a happy end. This is a 4.5/5 for me! Hope it will end like jumanji I don\\'t like this game. I mean drama... no wait game! Oh whatever! This game drama... So much in this game makes no sense at all and it\\'s killing the story for me. I dont understand, though im still in ep9, how does Sejoo and Marco play the game? Do they use the lenses as well? Cha Hyungseok too.. Also how come nobody noticed Sejoo fainting at the train station if he was still alive. Pretty sure the point of this drama is the cool CGI. Not really sure where this drama is going and the constant quests/battles are beginning to annoy me. I fast-forward through all of them... they bore me. Now we have zombies?!!!! WTF? The only thing keeping me watching is finding Se-Ju. So, after finishing the latest episode, a thought suddenly popped up. It was about my theory of how things are messed up, the glitches, the death of the players and the \"Head Up Displays\" and many more that kept appearing without the contact lens. So, if I were the writer, I would create my logic just like this. I watch this tv show on Netflix connected to my TV so that I can watch it within 15min cause nothing much happens. It\\'s very slow and repetitive much like W . \"Fast forward button, oh what would I do without you \" This drama really just ripped my heart from my chest, crushed it, and kicked both of my dogs while they were asleep. Emotional and fascinating science fiction stories. Hyun Bin managed to perform a great and fulfilling act. 5 stars for him. Please give them best awards drama - best actors - best couple - best plot - best director . They deserve it 10000000000%. Better if dispatch can report that Hyun Bin and Park Shin Hye are dating #wish2018_endofyear Congratulations internationally as this Kdrama is so innovative and up to date with modern environment of Techno virtuality.It has many substances that got you really addictive to: action, thriller and romance that easily view by all ages. Love it and hope to see more of clever script writers air in Netflix globally!! I just hope I can finish this drama without losing my hair and my one brain cell Hyun Bin & intelligent perfect script! Thanks all!!! Hope we can watch more than 16!!! Love all!! It\\'s so good I am afraid I will loose all my hair by the episode 16:\\'D This drama had my blood pressure up every episode. It\\'s so good!!! Great cast and storyline. The only problem is it moves forward really slowly because at least 30 minutes of every episode is just recap of previous episodes. I\\'ve seen the same scenes like 40 times now. I wish they would stop showing the same stuff over and over and move forward with the storyline at a better pace. Great show otherwise. Beyond hooked with this kdrama. It keeps getting better and better on and on as the serial progresses. Too many plot twists and Hyun Bin and Shin hye have killed it with their acting skills. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the relationship of Ceo and shin hye\\'s sister. Can\\'t wait for the upcoming episodes! So happy netlfix bought it This kdrama got me hooked that I got annoyed while waiting for the next episode. I began counting day of when the next episode will come out. Memories of Alhambra is my best kdrama as of now and I’m dead if to watch the next episode. The movie is so unpredictable and full of suspense that will drag you to the next episode. Stay tune and keep watching you won’t regret it. At first i wasn\\'t sure of this kdrama...Now I\\'m hooked!!!! It gets more interesting after episode 4 in my modest opinion...Because that\\'s when everything goes to hell...And it becomes a lot of more interesting;) Every episode gets better and better to be honest. Im on the 7th episode and I\\'m getting hooked to it. Always leaving in a cliff hanging episodes. I\\'m still looking for answers on the mysteries of this drama like where the hell Chanyeol goes? Hahah I\\'m wondering why everytime Chanyeol was in a drama he is always missing. (see Missing 9) Lol Please get married Hyun BIn and Park Shin Hye. Magic couple I am currently hooked with this drama. I thought I was going to give up while watching episode 1 since I am not a gamer and will get bored. I’m glad I stayed through the whole first episode and things are began getting interesting. I can\\'t wait for new episodes OMG this drama is superb! At first I was like, what the heck with all this game I don\\'t like this drama at all it\\'s so boring bla bla bla, and I was about to just stop watching at ep.3 or 4. But people believe me.....keep watching, I keep on watching \\'cause I love Hyun Bin and seriously it gets better and better and so unpredictable. It\\'s not just about the game I promise. It\\'s so good you won\\'t be disappointed. This one is just like my favorite food! I\\'m craving for the next episode:D U remain awestruck after watching each episode ..highly recommended... channeyy as a minor hehe..cute!! At least now we kinda have similar age!! Go for it. You won\\'t regret!! A new kdrama indeed. Saw many parallels between the plots between W and MOA and then realised the screenwriter is the same for both. The idea where virtual simulation transcends into reality is a scary idea that seems to be rearing its ugly head into the real real world, like people marrying their avatars or cartoon characters and loners who sink into VR and ignore reality. I\\'m at episode 3 and an really not sure if I like it or not. Her father just died, but really not sure if I like it. Mostly because the story seems flawed. Like what the deal with the game, it just makes no sense. The story is slow but i love the the drama though OMG i can\\'t wait to the next eps.... it\\'s already a halfway and they didn\\'t kiss yet haha... story line was amazing and the actor was so great... I LOVE THEM Why people ship hyun bin and park shin hye together. They didnt know park shin hye already have a bf??? This drama is so exciting. It has you wondering what will happen next. Truly one of the best k-dramas ever?? no words ...story line is just beyond perfection unlike other k dramas...i may have seen many many k dramas..but this is really in another level...their acting is also great....i recommend this drama to everyone....really a must watch... Hyun Bin and Park Shin Hye, get married after the drama is airing. Be happy together . AMEN 2 episodes per week is not enough.... unpredictable story.. HB as always charming.. This drama deserves highest rating!!????? Can\\'t wait for episode 9 Finally he had a good drama that is actually worth to be praised for his outstanding performance and masterpiece works. I will be disappointed if he didn\\'t get recognized for this drama and still Secret Garden. Secret Garden is a fun drama but not meaningful and memorable. So hands down to Memories of Alhambra and The Snow Queen his two best productions. i really love this series. cant believe we already on half season. the plot get more and more interesting. i hope they going to keep this pace of tenses and keep PPL at minimum until season finale (like how they do on DotS. 15 ep full story. 1 ep PPL galore) I\\'m just addicted to this drama. The best plot so far among all drama i\\'ve watched . And since , i shipp Hyun Bin and Park Shin Hye . I like their chemistry. I especially noted their very good acting. Highly recomended drama This is a masterpiece! i love the storyline, it makes me curious about the next episode. i hope the ending will not dissapointing. I still don\\'t understand why writernim makes Zinu for using a crutches. Why He is not back To normal? Hmm yeah, I just thinking why bcause it is not Like another drama I really loooveeee Seo Junghoon. He is so loyal and cute. Really love the chemistry. Unique story unlike the other kdramas today. This deserves an award! When i start to watch this drama because some of my friends recommended it to me, they are said MoA ia really different from other drama but have same feeling with W drama, but when in the middle of ep 1 i got boring for some scene, is really really impossible plot, i don\\'t like the game thing, but i Will give it a try and watch it until the end of ep 1. You know what after i watch ep 1,i got hooked for this Alhambra drama, really awesome, so interesting, everything is sooo nice alongside with the actors and actress.. cant wait again for every weekend, iya really mind blowing awesome drama. Iya drama of the year for me I think that se joo killed his friend Marco by accident in the game like mr. yoo killed mr. cha. Now Marco keeps following se joo everywhere to kill him like mr.cha does to Mr. Yoo. This is what I don\\'t see in other Korean drama romances. The romance scene is really meaningful. not suddenly love at 1st sight, kiss immediately, suddenly accidentally hug because this is real life, the name of love is not as sweet as that. The emotional bonding is really, really slow, but surely and deep. Really cool Whats the point of PSH character? Crying for all this episode.... I\\'m in love with this drama, and their chemistry so great!! Cant hardly wait for next episode... I just can\\'t wait till the end. This drama is not like the other. OMG im so excited! can tvn airing this drama 3 times a week? I just can see PSH character crying for all this episode? Even this drama doesn\\'t need PSH character. Hooked with its every episode from the start!! Not so ordinary drama with unpreductable twists of story. This drama is soooo underrated. How can people say this drama is boring but watch encounter, the typical love romantic drama. I like this drama because of the plot. Its unique and not cliche. I don\\'t know how some people can\\'t understand this plot. They say it\\'s confusing and boring and they arise so many questions. Like these questions are created so that the drama is interesting. You have to watch more episodes to know some unanswered questions. For me this drama is so good not that cringe plot. The idea of game is good. And every episode keeps me at the edge of seat. People should watch this. I love these drama but the pace is a bit slow.. not so many plot for each episode.. its already episode 8 but still no see joo.. and still no romance between jin woo and hee joo.. I love the suspense but its already halfway for the entire drama.. I hate when sometimes drama tend to rush things toward the ends.. really hoping chanyeol will show up soon.. he’s the reason why they met.. its almost like chanyeol only a cameo for this drama.. 8 more episodes to go.. waiting for episode 9 is killing me. is channel still alive? or not? I don\\'t understand, can\\'t wait to see the next episodes It\\'s not dull or boring...We just need to understand the story well and for sure we will enjoy it! At first episode I couldnt comprehend the story but later on I found the story very interesting. The Characters did well.??? Love it Amazing drama!! Chemistry between PSH and Hyun Bin is great!! Action scenes are super buper!! Scenario is more awesome!! If you loved W:Two World, you should especially watch Memories of the Alhambra without hesitation. Both of them has the same screenwriter. Go go go. Watch it. This will be one of the epic dramas in the korean drama history. Absolutely love the series! Exciting... really interesting...w8in 4 new episodes... Daebak...it\\'s really exciting to watch dis drama...the plot is really dynamic and surely interesting ...desperately waiting for new episodes...shin hye is really beautiful and acts really well..u gt a new fan here... I find this drama to be very dull and boring. I got past episode 2 but that was really difficult for me. I prefer to have a plot that more dynamic and interesting. The characters seem flat and the setting is difficult to comprehend. This one is fantastic Love love LoveLoveLoveLoveLove A drama that holds one in its grip and does not let go even between weekly episodes I have just one thing to say: Get Married Hyun Bin and Park Shin Hye . You\\'ll regret if you don\\'t do it. You are so good together to waste your time with others persons. super love this drama...super love PSH and HB..can\\'t wait for the next ep oppa hyun bin is so handsome and acting is superb. <3 cant wait for new episodes ^_^ Best k drama I had ever watch so far. Only reason i was watching this drama bcz of chaneyol but o guess this is an intresting drama with lot of suspence okay jinwoo is handicapped for the rest of his life, but i just realized he is okay on train in the last part of eps 2. does anyone have theory for this. i can\\'t sleep tonight before i figure out how the plot will lead us This Kdrama is amazing, one of the best of the year without doubt. Where most Kdramas are typically slow and don\\'t even get started until about 6 episodes in this one throws everything at you right from the start! What a rollercoaster ride and I can\\'t wait for each episode to air now! MISS THIS AT YOUR PERIL!! oh my hyun bin so handsome..i love the story. I thought that the games would not end. When the love enters in the scene, its so excited between the two .. it struck me , butterflies in my stomach roaming around..so goeey, since the man is rich Best kdrama eveeeerr ☁??☁??☁ Best kdrama eveeeerr ☁??☁??☁ thrilling!!! plus Hyun Bin looked dapper in hospital pajamas... Best kdrama ever Love this drama? Omg very nice every episodes give me chills! A really heart pounding one...reaaly hyun bin is always amazing in acting We weel done love watching everyone is good, I love park shin hye and her sister so cute... Gosh.. this drama was so amazing seriously!!! I cant wait for the next episode. Park shin hye and hyun bin was great actor, i impressed so much. Good luck for this drama I just watched all episodes (thus far) and wow, I just loved it. The plot is interesting, the backstory as well, the settings, the actors . . . I\\'ve to say that this is the best Kdrama I have watched so far (and I have watched a lot lol).\\ufeff Great drama! very interesting plot . I\\'m curious of what will happened in next episodes. Hyun Bin\\'s acting is no joke . High level I love this drama.. Can\\'t wait for another episode.. i dont understand. that\\'s it! a lot of questions come up to my mind. i think i should wait until the last eps released, so that I MAY get the stroryline. poor me;( I do not have any knowledge on AR game and surprisingly im enjoying it. At this point theres no sign about romance between the leads but there are people who commented as tho there is. Have they really watched the 4 episodes? I\\'m probably the only one, but I\\'m not impressed by this drama. Even though its subject is augmented reality, the tech angle is completely missing. And even if I only look at the non-tech angle, for example the romance between Hyun-Bin and Park Shin-Hye, it seems to be full of \"rich man poor woman\" clichés. As soon as he wrote her a cheque for 10 million, I stopped watching. I\\'m sorry, but I much prefer the Japanese manga \"Sword Art Online\", where there was real tech and true romance. I feel like they should\\'ve licensed the Japanese story for this drama; instead, they just made a few borrowings from it and ruined them with clichés. The plot is really interesting because it is not like any other action thriller or romance drama, hence you can\\'t predict what scene to comes next. This drama, makes you use your brain to identify the scenes, whether it is a flashback, or from the past or the present times. Overall, i\\'m really hooked on this drama I LIKE IT , it\\'s on my top list of favourite dramas of all time . Please get married Hyun Bin and Park Shin Hye THE BEST DRAMA!!!!!! HB is good actor First time saw the bad guy in this movie look so familiar. Just realized that he was one of the armies in DOTS. His character totally different. aaaahhhhh!!!!! michhigene(its making me crazy) I can\\'t help, but compare this Korean drama to the Japanese manga \"Sword Art Online\". One is about augmented reality, and the other is about virtual reality, but otherwise there are many similiraties (or should I say \"borrowings\"). Well, I\\'m sorry to say that the Japanese story is ten times better (not to mention ten years earlier). For starters, in \"Sword Art Online\", the boy-girl relationship slowly develops inside the game, without them knowing their real identity, and while they are both fighting for their lives. In \"Memories of the Alhambra\", the girl\\'s life is not in danger. She just falls in love with the boy just because he writes her a check for 10 million. What is she, a call girl? And what\\'s with the boy\\'s 2 ex-wives? The added rich-poor story is ruining everything. this and sky castle are my favorite drama right now!! Duh how could one find the plot \\'messy\\'? Its good, i dont think all kdramas are made to be \\'easy\\' and simple to understand. I know that this drama is going to be as good as W. Im so upset that ppl said they dont want the ending to be as messed up as W.. like W is so amazing and even the ending is good. Hyun bin is my favourite idol since Secret Garden, and he is really suitable for CEO role... He picked a good serial, which still shows his true character, elegant and not noisy.. And the storyline, absolutely unpredictable.. I cant wait the next episodes, and keep on curious what happen with the game creator.. Jung Se Ju.. did he got killed in the game? or did he die for true? Had a hard time getting through ep one. I was completely through at how weak Park Shin Hye\\'s character is in the end. Hoping episode 2 is better. I\\'m loving this drama so much so far! It really is a refreshing new plot for a korean drama. Park Shinhye and Hyunbin really suit each other well and their characters have great chemistry. This drama is Amazing! So addictive! Somehow I am glad that I didn\\'t cancel my Netflix subscriptions. I couldn\\'t wait for the next episode. Waiting for the weekend is a torture.??? This drama is truly amazing! The plot is so original and you can never guess what will happen next. I\\'m so excited for the next episode and I\\'m impatient since I\\'m so curious to see what\\'s going on! Love it so far..love Hyunbin and Park Shin hye pairing.. Love it? i just found out only 2 days have passed after 4 eps, lol Just finished watching eps 4 and I can\\'t wait for next episode So addicted. So there is a bug with the game. Even it\\'s not logical but it\\'s really interesting to watch. Drama is the world when we escape from real world. Love this one I watched ep 4 already and it beyond my words. I can’t guess wht is coming in the next episode. I keep wondering wht happen next, and wht happen in the process. I got hooked and cant wait for the next episode. Amazing drama with perfect OTP in Hyun Bin and Park Shin Hye. a lil bit \"messy\" and complicated story line and plot... anyone who love easy, romantic comedy, fun korean drama, you must try a lil bit harder to understand?.. hopefully ep 4 will be better Wow wow I only watched the first three episodes until now, but I most say that it was absolutely amazing. For what I think, this drama have a different story from most of the dramas. Wooowww this drama is so good. I am big fan of park shin hye and im little worry about her comeback. But now im so proud with her. This drama is so good. I like hyunbin, but there is funny scene and then i can imagine if gong yoo play the character the scene will be so much funny HAHAH. Song jae Jung, what a brilliant drama you always write??? This drama is so good. The acting is on point and this is the first time I\\'m watching Hyun Bin\\'s drama and I\\'m already in love with him. And as always my park shin Hye she makes me cry laugh smile along with her. This drama is Daebak. The story is developing quite fast. I\\'m already hooked .waiting for 4th episode ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ and yeah chanyeol is a bonus.♥️♥️ The concept of AR seems so interesting and refreshing the scenery. I think I am gonna really love this drama. Park Shin Hye looks a lot like Lee Se Young from Hwayugi.... SAO detected.. not bad..:D the idea of AR game is really good, but i just don\\'t like the plot WTF this story line about VR / AR GAME!!! waiting to long k-drama like this!! Daebakkk Epic!! I\\'m Gamer and i like Korean Drama .. and i found this .. OMG worth to watch till end! Please Park Shin Hye sing in OST... Espectacular Song Jae Jung’s unique, original plot, compact script, Ahn Gil Ho’s detailed attention given to incorporation of AR game in reality with beautiful scenery of Barcelona/ Granada and Leads Hyun Bin - Park Shin Hye superb visuals and acting produces a sensational production in Memories of the Alhambra @Ally iloveyou my Queen Park Shin Hye Really interesting but still can\\'t accept the contact lens technology. Like how a contact lens could do so much like altering ur sensory receptor etc. Good drama ini enjoy and waiting acting shinye unie As per initial episode basically it\\'s catch the interest of the viewer more power to park shin hye best acting as ever Does anyone know the name of the song during the preview for the next episode/credits? Thank you! This is sword art online LOL It\\'s good and really interesting. Still can\\'t accept the technology tho. How is it possible to alter ur sensory receptor when the only technology that attached in ur body is contact lens and earphone except u have some brain modification lol. Love this new show!!! Totally different story yet so enticing and exciting!!! unique story and great chemistry. in love with Park Shin Hye and Hyun Bin couple Anyone know what the song during the credits/next episode preview is called? Exciting drama.cause the story is unique.& i want to see psh in a drama. I Really Enjoyed it . Park Shin Hye is So beautiful I love the story and the rapport of shin hye and hyunbin This drama is so good so far! It’s really refreshing to see a new concept. It kinda reminds me of sword art online?, sorry i’m such a weeb that feeling when you play COD in real life.. Park Shin Hye and Park Chanyeol. Can\\'t wait for their siblings interaction! Eps 2 is even better than eps 1!!!! Really loves this drama~~ not your typical kdrama! So fresh!! OMG first episode got me hooked! Hyun Bin soooo great actor i miss him so much i uttered hes so handsome hes so handsome Addicted to this drama!!!!!! get my Netflix connexion because of it . Great scenario ever in drama. Good job all. And the couple Hyun Bin and Park Shin Hye is really charming. Honnestly, i think this drama has better scenario than Encounter which is so predictable with a mature woman loving young poor boy and already seen in Pretty Noona who buys me some foods . Can\\'t wait of all next episode #MemoriesOfTheAlhambra FIGHTING WOW! I think this drama is going to be amazing! The first episode was super interesting and I can\\'t wait to see the next one. This drama is so refreshing. I kinda understand why other people can\\'t get it. It\\'s so unique that others might find it weird. But I find it really awesome! Geeks would love this! Gamers would love this! Everyone should love this!? daebakkkkkkkkkkkkk ommmmmoooo first episode was so great cant wait for episode 2 fighting MOA. WOW! the story is so sensational and thrilling , not boring ! Good job, i can\\'t wait of episode 2!

Mainly because some of the scenes were filmed in my city and saw all the cameras, actors and actresses, the staff...in the street. They were a bit bossy but i understand the situation they were in too. I find it funny how these two got lead offers for Fox Bride Star but both turned it down just to be back together for this drama. lol. But I\\'ll definitely keep my eye on this drama. WOWOWOWOWOW. Some Chanyeol stan i am lol, i didn\\'t find out about this drama until i saw it on my IG feed that Channie was on his way Hungary to film this. By looking at the cast, i\\'m excited Park Shin Hye is in it. She\\'s my girl!! Definitely excited to see an OG actress back on the screen again. The plot looks promising, hopefully it won\\'t be like another \"missing 9\" for me lol. Can\\'t wait till November:) This does sound good. I like that Park Shin Hye has really begun to play adult roles. I\\'m looking forward to this drama. Ooooooo!! This sounds like it\\'ll be so good. I\\'ve been missing Shinhye lately. Shinhye and Hyunbin will look so well together! And as always I\\'m excited to see my baby Chanyeol in a drama again! im loving all these exo and park shin hye interactions. YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSS My only wish is the episodes are at least 20/24 instead of 16 november is fast coming ..... this is what i am waiting for I have a strange feeling with the \"strange\" affair they\\'re saying on the synopsis.

I know Hyun Bin had big success in movies with 2 box office in 2017 but i really missed him in drama since Secret Garden and Hyde Jekyll Me. And all in this drama is exciting, the cast, the storyline ..... Counting the months May ... June ... July... August ... Seppt ... Oct .... NOVEMBER yahhh Hyun Bin, Park shinhye and Chanyeol wahh definitely I will watch this drama... Too excited ... can\\'t wait chanyeol oppa . Finally another cast to join this drama hahha. Chanyeol. Cant wait EXO\\'s Chanyeol to join this drama as PSH\\'s bother. yayyyy Cant wait their chemistry together since shin hye is famous with chemistry with her partner (even with a goat - u know if u watch three meals a day variety show!) Are they seriously still not going to announce the supporting cast?:))) Hopefully the supporting casts are also superb at acting that will match psh’s and hb’s acting?????? I guess those haters of psh who commented here are just feeling threatened by her because she is more famous than their favourite actresses. Some actresses that the haters suggested aren\\'t even that great in acting. Keep on hating haters while PSH earning money and beat your favourite actresses. I wonder why you guys come to this page only to hate on her. She isnt that bad in acting too compared to other actresses around her age, in fact she is one of the best and an A-list actress who is highly sought after by drama\\'s pd in Korea. Considering the ratings for her past dramas, her popularity is no joke in Korea. november noo into next year long wait then Filming begins at may, but there isnt news about supporting cast.. I hope sungjoon huhuhu I am waiting excitedly. psh and hyun bin fighting! can’t wait for this drama! goodluck! ji soo for the major supporting role please please xxxxxx Ji Soo soo oppa Finally my queen has confirmed ....want to see this drama....love u and congrats....Dr all the best waiting for first episode OMG! I am literally screaming my head off because i have my absolute favs in one drama. I will be waiting for this one impatiently. OMG Psh prove some only some haters of yours because many loves you that you are a good actress..im excited for this drama with hyun bin..wishing that you will have a duet together because both of you can sing..see you on November Memories of the Alhambra..fighting Why \"Memories of the Alhambra\" is the most anticipated drama of 2018? finally i can see them together in a drama ...i\\'m so excited Waiting to see my oppppaaaa Hyun bin..... Looking forward to this drama Finalyyyyyyyyu psh confirmed, cant wait! The next my mister iu let\\'s rock KdramaLand ShinHye, yes.. ParkShinHye confirmed.. can\\'t wait to see u my Queen PSH must to accept this drama. its been long time since doctor and as her fans I really miss her so much. Have park shin hye and hyun bin will be great. @Avid Watcher my lovely sam soon, secret garden and Hyde Jekyll, Me @Sr26 and Iknow ... kindly list in which dramas he has played same role? Why to always make bad judgements basis on short synopsis. If you have so much interest in controversies... than dont give a thought to watch it. God how a people like you, can think so much negative about actors. I feel so much pity on people like who always see bad in every thing. Change ur perspective. You people are not even near to healthy mindset. please get a different female lead, no more PSH pls I have never considered hyunbin as a an outstanding actor, but he really have Fantasy drama... Hyunbin is really typecast actor, playing the same role in 3 his drama now. And the writer from W drama of course this one will be male centries story. Good luck for PSH hope she can\\'t get controversies about her role, like Hanhyojoo get in W before. I waiting for park shin hye drama I hope PSH accepts the role! I miss seeing her in dramas! And the age difference isn\\'t that much, and an older male lead might prove to be interesting. Actually we got nothing from the plot ,there must be something more interesting than that .I liked w two worlds so that\\'s why I might watch this drama . after watching movie actors comeback to small screen I hope Hyun Bin like Gong Yoo,, He has to be casted n paired with movie actress too,,, there are tons of movie actresses can do that,,, PSH??? Hmmmm The director has to think more about it. But for PSH experience its okay, she is good also I am so excite about the drama, all combinations are look good, tvN, pd, writer and especially Hyun Bin!! Wish you got a right actress to complete the fabulous drama. Looking forward to see you. what is the role of the female lead? they did not mention anything about her! Lol at those people who keep mentioning their faves and some of them are not even that good. I hope Shinhye accepts it of the female role is well written. So happy for Hyunbin tho? Gong Hyo Jin? We Need Ha ji won and Hyun bin in an action movie together they would be like Mr & Mrs Smith , like Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt please. @Panda He is 35 years old and she is 39 not big difference I don\\'t think Ha Ji Won would accept this role if they offer it to her Hyun Bin is too old for park shin hye, they should cast an actress that around his age so their chemistry would be good . @Panda Hyun bin also old, he even looks older than Ha Ji Won I want Seo Hyun Jin with Hyun Bin please... Ha ji won too old for hyun bin Pls Accept My Princess Shin Hye.. Please consider Park Min Young or Jo Yoon-Hee , Son Ye Jin, but no Park Shin Hye. Please accept the role Park Shin Hye.. heol.... hyun bin saranghae.... @pentium Hajiwon cast action drama in kbs. oooh yay very interesting she will defintely pick this role Whoa Park Shin Hye Finally Yes Unnie Accept It??! Seo Ji Hye;) No Park Shin Hye -_- please Ha Ji Won please @minnie & @vinividivici LOL lol I can\\'t believe tvN is trying to snatch the leads from SBS drama Please accept the female role shinhye please:( Just my opinion, why the plot look like black knight? Park shin hyeeeeeee!!!!! Park shin hye please accept the female lead role.. Agree with @minnie, Hyun bin always pairing with the great actress in his drama. But PSH..... ckckck Yes Hyunbin comeback drama, and of course PSH will be the bad ever female lead acting in HB drama.

       "  'comments': \"Love this drama so much! It’s very heart warming and touching. Park Se Wan and Jang dong Yoon have amazing chemistry. The plot is so relatable to high schoolers as it talks abt life and relationships with friends and family as well. Highly recommended d. I cried so much watching this. The Osts are amazing too!!!❤️❤️ Quick review if you're wondering whether or not you should watch it: I'd say if you have nothing else to do, it's not a terrible way to pass some time. Better plot than School 2017. They should have made this the School 201 instead. I like the reason Shieun mentioned why she wanted to make movies. OSTs are awesome too. I just watched episode 8 and loved how the stroy has developed. It's so relatable...how youths fight to understand their lot in life and eventually accept who they are and how they can grow from there in spite of all their challenges. Also lovely to see the parent-child relationship and how the two generations begin to appreciate and trust each other. Disappointed in the low ratings just because there are no stars in this modest but great cast. And the artistic filming is yet another factor that makes this series a must watch. This drama is so close to reality, me myself as an undergraduate always feel the same thing right when i was in the highschool. A feeling to choose between play safe or give everything you got for your dream and still might be failed. I salute to this kind of korean drama that put romance vibes in the second place, not as a main storyline. Park se-wan & Jang dong yoon reunion from school 2017 gives this drama quick & well accepted feelings to everyone and it is a great move. Thanks for the drama. This drama makes me smile and cry, even though it's short drama. My tears for this drama is so worth it thank you so much for making this drama. Great story line, slice of life and shows how friendship is important. I'll miss this and the whole cast 나는 정말 고마워. Watch this peeps highly recommended. Its a great short drama. Why it has a low ratings? Just watch and enjoy peeps! ✌? Tears my eyes. Thank you for such a beautiful drama. Thank you Park Hyun suk for working with Kwon Hye Ji for the second time! I think this is one of the best writers you are working with as a Primary PD. . Hope you will worl with her again... Fighting KBS! I cried while watching this drama... Fyi i did not even cried watching goblin. I think bcuz it is so realistic. It shows perspective fromteenagers n adult. So this is one drama that is good for parents n children to watch n discuss. Best Drama Ever. It has superb cinematography and back sound. It captures my heart, gives me this lingering heartwarming feeling. I relate to this drama a lot especially 2 years ago when I just graduated high school and didnt know what to do next. Kim shi eun is just like me, the difference is I give up on my dream because I failed getting into the course I wanted. It's okay tho. Kudos to all cast and crew who made this drama. It's very realistic and close to my heart. Thank You this drama deserves everything! the events are so realistic and all the actors capture their roles perfectly. idk why but this drama really is different from all the others, i hope it gets the ratings it deserves Please what time does this drama air? Park Se Wan and Jang Dong Yoon succeeded to make a chemist as young couple properly. In episode 7-10 the plot is improving, but i'm afraid there will be a storm in the next episode:( This drama is like a dream, coming unexpected but give me a deep and long lasting feeling A must watch drama!! It gives a different vibes compared to other dramas It's intresting drama, but why have low rating somehow i can relate with this drama so much. The struggles of a teenager and how it feels like nobody understand her situation.. I think the director n writer did a very good job portraying the whole thing. the main leads also have such good chemistry together, reminded me of my old time on having a crush with boy. I hope they keep the story realistic until the end. two tumbs up from me!! what the tittle and singer of the soundtrack trailer from episode 5-6? im so disappointed by the ratings, this drama deserves all the love. its truly a hidden gem, so fun to watch, kinda feels like watching a slice of life and sports anime. love it. give it a try guys! what this tittle soundtrack? It's a fun drama! I'll watch it because of Kim Soo Hyun, cutie!!? This drama give me Girls Generation 1979 drama vibe the point of view in this drama is so beautiful. Im not a fan of dancing but I really enjoy watching this. Strangely awesome Mannn I love it! It's not dissapointing so far. So far so good! they are not showing this on kbs world. My most anticipated drama on Dec 2018. Kwon Hye Ji is back, with a Park Hyun Suk PD Nim. Too good to be true. Oh My God, KBS, it's too good to be true. Kwon Hye Ji and Park Hyun Suk team up is too good to be true!\",\n",

       "  'comments': 'Most hilarious thriller I’ve seen. Brilliant team of writers. 1000/10 would recommend I really don\\'t like Tae Hee character. She promise will keep the secret but then she\\'s the one that go to police station to confess and cause everything become complicated. When Jang Hyun Min is after Tae Hee, she\\'s in fear but she\\'s more worry about bakery shop than her own life. At the end, make things complicated...undecisive. A really funny story, a murderer who falls from a height but he is just fine. A really bad story. Bae Yeo Wool is the heroin that I\\'ve been dreaming of. She is so perfect! I can\\'t wait to see her reaction when she finds out about room 101 aka Tae-hee betrayed her. The plot also perfectly focused on them characters. I am very liking it! Gotta free some data to save this series! Definitely saving this series hell yeah! Am I the only who remembered the serial killer is protected by cheon man? and most of the police are on cheon man side.. that is why he is a \"free-man\"... and cheon man also already gave him a way to get out of korea but he choose to stay... cheon man is a corrupted police. and the reason why he keeps helping the serial killer is if the nation know the real killer of kwon soo ah and yeo wool\\'s mom, nation will know the misbehavior of cheon man. i admit some of the plot is not so good but i do understand why this man always get his getaway... i dont think the plot is too ridiculous when you talk about high profile serial killer with polices to back him up. LOL you guys! drama at time arent suppose to make sense , because its a freaking drama K-drama screen writers are the only writers on earth that can make a Crime, Detective, Psychological thriller feels totally like a comedy. That\\'s skill. This drama is getting unnerving. I couldn\\'t wait to see the next ep It was promising for the first 3 episodes and the writers get lazy, removing evidence and escaping from police is like walk in the park. Such a shame but I\\'m dropping this after episode 5, the story become just too ridiculous now interesting storyline and refreshing plot so far. of course, it is too far from the ordinary but i like the originality. on a side note, baro’s acting bothers me a lot. i cringe every time it’s his lines. i hope he’ll improve. episode 5 got me SOOOOOOOO angry, how the writers can script this psychopathic killer prance around so freely killing at will, visiting witnesses without any police escorts!!!...Im hoping Eun Sun-Jea vents all her anger and vengeance on these crocked cops/detectives/politicians and clean this mess of a drama!! The series had the wrong name, it should be named, “More Than Evil”. The screenwriter has portrayed protagonist to be more evil than serial murder (at least, villain was honest). Honestly, he didn’t care about his wife at all. Yes, he felt guilty, but that’s it. I really just want jang Hyun min to go and die he’s such a bastard I don’t really care even if it’s just acting he was such a cold blooded killer in bad Detective that I couldn’t help but curse him to die every time I watched an episode??? Maybe I’m just petty but I really can’t think highly off him and probably never will? This drama is annoying as hell, Tae-Seok maybe one that uses lawless techniques to solve cases and still keep his moral compass facing north, but his approach to the past truth is pathetic to the point people he wants dead are alive and people he\\'s trying to protect are dying!!! Sun-Jae has a better understanding of how lawless justice should be handled fuelled by revenge (and amnesia), but its good to have her siding with Tae-Seok at critical moments. If another Tae-Seok stupid decisions causes a death with one of the SNS members....im going to give up on this drama!!!!!! I can\\'t read any negative comment before I watch. but when I read any negative comments, I will never watch them because the negativity will keep playing in my head. Is there a line of common sense, logic, and reasoning Kdrama would not cross for the sake of telling a story? I guess not. I have no problem with the premise of the story; a cop is willing to sidestep the law to apprehend evil criminal, I like that, but this drama is so totally void of common sense and logic that makes it a complete nonsense. Woww this drama so insteresting and so intense!! All the character so good potraying their character... wow jang hyung min as villian damn make me want to kill him so badly!! Haha.. i can\\'t wait for more episode!! Eun sun jae character so mystery!! I thot she is bae yeo wool!! This drama is just amazing!!!! I really love the main character This series is amazing! The actor and actress are great. They were amazing at portraying their respective character. It\\'s perfect! It\\'s already ep 4, and I can\\'t wait for more! Wohooo. I just so happy of how complicate each episodes are. Credit to the actor and actress. OMo ITs such an interesting and thrilling drama lol. I wasn\\'t having much expectations from this one since its been months I watched any suspense thriller genre but this one really got me bad!! I loved it so much damn!! It\\'s a masterpiece for me. I know I am being hyped up since there r only 2 episodes out at The moment but still, I think premiere rocked it! Highly recommended, watch it even if you dont want to cause leads already have a simmering chemistry hot!! I am burnt to the core! The title look so evil... Interesting plot, psychopath term... Ughhh, i am so done Really interesting plot line, you have me intrigued ... can\\'t wait to watch. Looking forward to it. Love dramas with new faces. Yaasss BARO!! I have mixed feelings about the drama title. I know they can’t use “Luther” or the Korean name counterpart of the protagonist because it’s not gonna sound right, but I was hoping for a more inventive title. Excited for Park Ho San! Yey... looking forward to know who they will be casting as the female lead @imsafiya i vote chun woo hee, esom or bae doona as alice...i might be dreaming but jeon do yeon would be really good as well. pleaseeeeeee get this right, please I vote for Shim Eun-kyung as Alice. I think she has the acting chops, the intelligence and the steely manner. She is a lot younger than Shin Ha-kyun, but there was also quite a big age gap between Elba and Wilson. Dasom could be the psychopath woman. I can imagine her into this role. Her acting in Unnie is alive was really good. If they did not finde a female leading role for this,they should come in contact with Dasom. holy sh*t... my fave BBC show is becoming a kdrama This should have been an OCN drama... they need to get the alice role spot!!! on!!! otherwise the whole remake will be ruined, shin ha kyun will do well enough in idris elba\\'s place but alice truly stole the show so........it\\'s a bit sticky First Life on Mars and now Luther? What next, Call the Midwife? Actually that might kinda work as a weekend drama... Quick, BBC, make your pitch to KBS or SBS!',\n",

       "  'comments': 'Although it doesn’t really have anything special to it, this is a really good drama if you just want to pass time. The leads have an amazing chemistry with an amazing romanctic plot. I like it!! Thanks Watching this for Yoo Seung Ho and Kwak DongYeon and i like Jo BoAh too. The start seems good. But I have to agree that Son SooJoung character seems a bit off. Her character lack of something. I mean sometimes the way SooJoung act doesn’t match with her personality. But Jo BoAh did very well with the expression and all. And wow I watched this to see Kwak DongYeong too and i have to say he looks so scary when he act as villain. I came here after i watched him in my iD gangnam and I love the sunbae character his playing but seeing him in this make me think wow he is such a great actor. All this while I’ve only see him acting as a good and nice character, Oh Seho suprise me a bit. But still he looks super handsome in here too. And of course uri Yoo SeungHo, the nice handsome guy we all need in every drama. Eheheh i wish he existed in my life and be my boyfriend. In series they used from a nice lyricless music. I am really curius about the name of music and its musician. anyway, I loved this drama. it\\'s nice to watch a drama that has captured my attention after a long time. The cinematography & bgm during some scenes is amazing Nice quote from K. Revenge. Finally got the last 2 episodes watched. Still wished we could have seen a wee bit of Oh See-Ho\\'s future...you know, maybe he became a priest or something. It was light felt, good felt. Thankfully, it didn\\'t go on and on like some dramas in the past. It seems the trend these days they aren\\'t going over the top with the endings with shorter episodes, etc. I can\\'t say I was as moved as in, um let\\'s say Just Between Lovers..but this drama did give some good moments to start the new year. the best plot and story line.. where\\'s LEE CHAE MIN?? im searching him until ep30.. I\\'ve been really let down at the last couple of episodes I watched. Hmmm... im going to rate this drama, it would be 6 out of 10.. they are all great actors, but its getting boring.. at episode 23-24 the female lead wants to protect the male lead, if she really wants to protect the male lead why she keeps on dating him? Teacher and student relationship is a no no. And they even flirting in school and kissinggg. Its sucks.. i feel bad for the 2nd male lead. When they release that piano bgm I don\\'t like this drama..its so boring The title is really a play on words. His name Bok-Soo also means revenge (복수) - so literally \"Revenge has come Back\". will there be a season two from my strange hero this is one of the best series I laugh those who hate Son Soo Jeong (Jo Bo Ah) character.. but I do understand you. It was in the past she\\'s annoying because of misunderstanding the rumor that spread by Oh Se Ho. that lie Oh Se Ho made.. but you know I love Son Soo Jeong so much the way she care Kang Bok Su. and admit it they have a chemistry.. hahaha lol I\\'m surprised to see so people hating Soo Jeong character... I really like her. I also love the chemistry, and the character of Kang Bok Su is so amazing, but i\\'m disappointed at the scenario, the debut was great but it turned in a basic drama school, predictable and with always the same problems of corruption. A part of me would like Oh Se-Ho to confess his love to Kang Bok-Su. I know that would be a first in a K-drama like this. I think we forget what a bad childhood Oh Se-Ho had and still probably has with his mom. He\\'s so complex. I dont see their chemistry. But i like yoo seungho. Hope he can have better partner Female lead is so annoying... Idk why ppl hating on Soo Jeong character, but I think everything that happens 9 yrs ago was a misunderstanding, N I like how she’s breaking up with Bok Soo so that he can finally graduates??♥️ Always been an admirer and supporter of oppa Yoo Seung Ho. Even if some of his more recent dramas are so-so, still viewing this one. i just realize Lee Kang Min and Jo Bo Ah already acted together in 3 dramas:\\') Really hate Seho\\'s mom!! Whats the piano ost for every episode I am not at episode 6-7 and It was sad that Bo ah\\'s role isn\\'t good. It is not her fault anyway, she\\'s still doing great in acting. If this role was given to other actresses it might have been worst but she knows what she\\'s doing that is why i still consider her acting great. It is just a shame that the role is so childish. It doesn\\'t depict her personality at some point! I agree with the other comment, dramas lately are boring, I normally drop them too after one to two episodes. This drama is interesting not only because I like the cast but I like the starting. Definitely this will end well. Even so if it will not end well still the whole thing is good because of the couple... Still can\\'t understand why they make jo bo ah\\'s character semm so right while the Seung ho\\'s friend character minji so irritating while in real life any guy would pick her over jo bo ah\\'s character. Dying for next episode Son Soo Jeong looks really cool in the arguing scene with Se Ho♥️ Really love Jo Bo Ah...And rooting for Kang Bok Su and Son Soo Jeong I am watching this drama only for the cute Yoo Seung Ho, otherwise this story is very irritating. Soo Jeong\\'s character is very annoying and selfish. Yet it is portrayed to be cute. She doesn\\'t believe him and betrayed him back then, which spoilt the life of Kang BokSo. Yet he seems okay with it and tries to be nice to her and eventually starts loving her again. I wish he chose Yang Minji, because she was always by his side and never left him all these 9 years, she couldn\\'t stand anyone saying bad about him, but alas, she is portrayed as annoying and she will be friendzoned by him. So far I like the plot but I still can\\'t get over the fact of bok soo and soo jeong together again I know they were kid but I cant fea over the fact that she didn\\'t trust and like if I were I would have accept her apology but part our ways because of the damage of my heart and her this drama is literally so goodd, dramas lately have been really boring i usually drop them after like the 3rd episode but this drama is cute and interesting. This drama seriously deserves so much more love, it\\'s sooo good This drama so good. i like Yoo Seung Ho, he is so cute. Great acting. the story derives from real life. In school, some students do not want to study because they are bullying, or because of their parents. Because their parents want their children to grow up because of the academic but they do not know what the child is doing because they are forced to study so on and so forth. If I were Bok Su leave the girl, besides the girl betrayed him. Well, I would suggest, Bok Su will prosper soon, he is so handsome. This is a really good show! Why is the rating so low? Yoo Seung Ho deserves so much love. It\\'s my 1st time seeing Kwak Dong Yeon act as antagonist. I\\'m hating him but I\\'m also pitying him. I love the way they tell the story. The characters have flaws, insecurities and failures...just like how humans are. Almost all of the casts are good artists, why isn\\'t this getting the love it deserves? Am I the only one that prefers and roots for kang boksu and son soojeong to be together? It\\'s just that they have lots of misunderstandings which caused all that. I feel that they are so cute together and are meant to be. Although minji is loyal, she is too clingy which makes boksu feel a bit suffocating. Kwak Dong-Yeon looks..oh so.. wicked in this drama. Needless, to say he always makes his characters worth watching. Honestly, I wasn\\'t sure what to expect in this drama. Especially, the first episode. Its definitely got me hooked now. My Strange Hero and I Here Your Voice Shoot at the same school I decided to watch this drama just because of Yoo Seung Ho. Whoever the first lead female is no matter for me. As his fan, I just enjoy watching his every drama whatever the story is. And i dont consider about the drama rating, I just want to support him like this by watching his scene... Fighting Seung Ho.. Yoo Seung Ho is simply captivating, gonna check him out in other dramas. Jo bo Ah is so beautiful and acts well too. I don\\'t dislike her character like many here. Soo-Jeong is suffering from a complex and she is struggling to survive. I like it that she can be rough and tough when the need arises. I love the storyline and at the same time the characters itself....Im just hoping that bok soo and min ji should be together not soo jeong....I dont like her..... I love yoo seung ho but not jo bo ah ... i prefer he choose minji ... minji is so devoted and loyal to him ... why... this drama really has amazing casts but why the plot is so messy? the characters don\\'t have a certain characteristic. i\\'m really confused about soo-jeong, is she a good or bad character. . ..i like the story.i love seung ho and bo ah.thanks for this drama.they made them a couple Well, my wife is the girl who cheated on me when I was in high school. The past is the past So, for the next episode Kang Bok-Su and Son Soo-Jeong is gonna have a lovey dovey moment like there is nothing happen in the past??? this is so stupid. I know this is K-Drama when true love always win in the end, but how can you say this stupid relationship a \"True Love\" when the man is just simply dumb and the women is too shameless. I love Yang Min-ji in this drama. She may be a brat or irritating sometimes but she always believe in Bok-su. She was with Bok-su for 9 years and she always believed that he didn\\'t push Oh Se-ho. And also, I feel sorry for her because Bok-su just treated her as a friend and never look on her. It\\'s still ep 6 but I already decide to hate Soo Jeong. A really stupid character! this drama seem to be confusing I\\'m so happy Yoo Seungho decided to come back as a high school student. He looks so cute in the uniform and this character \"Kang Boksoo\" is lighter than all his previous characters. It\\'s so easy to root for him. He is broken but still kept his good heart. Can\\'t wait the next epiaodes. Can\\'t wait for ep3!!! Kang bok su come back for his revenge to son soo jeong n Oh se ho. Fighting seung ho!! Aa! I still love his drama \"master of the mask\" with kim so hyun. he really awesome! Love it. I love yoo seung ho so so much? i love all of his dramas because his acting always great??? Episode 1 was amazing but episode 2 is do disappointing.. Son Soo Jeong really thought that Bok Su push that guy from the rooftop, so I don’t hate her for that I love this drama because Jo Bo Ah and Kwak Dong Yeon is here. I still cant shake the character of Yoo Seung Ho when he did the I Am Not A Robot. But the storyline is great and i have high hopes for this one.?? Okay I just loved Yoo Seung-Ho here. So far really hate Jo Bo Ah. Sorry not gonna continue it. Episode 2 really made me frustrate Jo Bo Ah never disappoints me??♥️ This drama is so good, first eps got me hooked already. Jo bo ah fighting!! Yoo Seung-Ho is one of my favorite actors, a pity that she does not have a more pleasant partner in this drama. But maybe it\\'s so deliberately - if she wants to avenge her ...:DD All I can say its a must watch drama seriously  Loving it so far but only watching because of my Yoo Seung Ho love him soo much. Love his acting here and in I am not a Robot. Love his dramas and the female lead is not so bad either. Only watched the first episode but totally hooked already. Three of my favorite genres in one is exciting to watch. Kang BokSu has gone through enough. I hope he gets his revenge. Kwak dong yeon better get a girl KDY is a villain..... I love it. They are so many nice dramas airing in the same season This drama must in tvbn broadcasting hahahha, so interesting, funny, superb actor DAEBAK Wait... isnt it an OST from School 2015, which is titled \"Reset\"? Wait isnt it the REPLAY OST playin in the teaser im gettin so many School 2015 feels I really can\\'t wait for this drama to be aired!!! Why does the new teaser have school 2015 ost? Cool tho Omg Can\\'t wait for this drama!! Yoo Seung Ho!! and then Yoo Seon Ho!!! I noticed that Yoo Seung Ho tends to dramas around in December through January. Can\\'t wait to see him in this drama. I can\\'t wait for this drama? I like to watch this drama so Intersted waiting yooseungho saranghae I can\\'t wait for this drama!!!!!!! I can wait for this drama!!!!!! i\\'m so glad to see another drama with kwak dong yeon oppa. gonna watch this drama for him. (of course, yoo seung ho is a great bonus.) hope to see dong yeon oppa as the lead actor next time.:) Kwak dong yeon oppa is back!?? i\\'m so happy to see him again. Gonna watch this drama because of him. Yoo seung ho oppa is a bonus.? Hope he can get a lead role next time. Yay! Finally a decent casting!? I couldn’t watch “I’m not a robot” because I can’t stand Chae Soo Bin!???? I like watching jo bo ah. Shes so cute and innocent. Jo Bo Ah <3 I seriously wanted Chae Soobin and Yo Seungho in another drama together. They have a lot of chemistry. Even if I\\'m not a robot didn\\'t have high ratings in Korea they were an international hit and Yoo seungho even said that it was his fav project and they both admitted that they love working together. They should both attend MBC awards for I\\'m not a robot and now they have both been casted in an SBS drama so I guess they can see each other in the MBC AND SBS drama awards at the end of this year!! excited for this one, yoo seungho\\'s back:) lol pamela kay, most plots are misleading, so don\\'t judge from now, I bet they\\'ll do something that makes sense They say here was a student so it means that were it started the story but it doesn\\'t mean that they are still a student in the story..I like Yoo Seung Ho any role he will be good on it... Pamela Kay sorry i disagree but i think yoo seung ho is totally still good to play high school student he looks young Why is he coming back as a high school student?? He\\'s now an adult so his ex and that guy must be adults too. So, why go back as a high schooler, plus, he doesn\\'t look like a high schooler. Unless, he\\'s going back to school to get his diploma I love both of them! Jo Bo Ah made me like her in Surplus Princess. Can\\'t wait! Yayy can\\'t wait? Finally jo boah confirmed. CANT WAIT! I hope yoo seung ho & kim so hyun come back for new drama.. I like the premise and became a fan if YSH after INAR .Hope the show does well. I hope she takes on the offer I can see the character in her I do hope she does please accept Jo Bo Ah Jo Bo Ah?????? Hope she accepts the offer!!! I wish jo bo ah would accept the offer Please accept the offer jo bo ah!??? I can’t wait!??? He was so incredible in Remember! He is the best when it’s about injustice. That kind of drama are the best’ just like «Angry Mom». I really really really really hope jo bo ah accepts the offer! I love seungho and I adore boah and I think they\\'d look great together! both are super talented. please boah say yes. I hope Jo Bo Ah will accept the role she\\'s a very good actress. Yes unni jo bo ah please pick love you in goodbye to goodbye fighting kim so hyun and seungho coming back together. shy shy couple forever and ever. likely very interesting I can\\'t wait surprise me with the female casting oooh I hope is ryu hwa young fighting!!!!!

       "  'comments': 'Pretty good! Interesting storyline and solid actors make for an engaging story. Lots I like about it, but I did get annoyed with her and her friends. Especially, episode 6 or maybe it was 7. Was pleased with the show. easy to watch becuase there wasn’t any huge conflict. wished it was 4 episodes longer because the ending was a bit rushed and wanted more character development for more characters. and wished they showed everyones success at the end...? Good ending, just wish the showed a bit more epilogue because it leaves the viewership curious about the other characters. I love the overall story. it is very light drama and has something to give to viewers. love the romance >< I\\'ve watched all the episodes...maybe because i am a fan of Kim Sohye, i would say that her acting was very good especially when it comes to cry scene...i cry everytime she cry...and also when it comes to comedic scene, she\\'s so cute...but there\\'s certain scene that can be improved...i like all of her friends character...they also good...overall, i like this drama, although, maybe it\\'s a little bit slow..i\"ll give 3.5 out of 5 stars. omg Boa’s friends did those terrible acts themselves... then Mina has tha audacity to blame and get mad at Boa for liking Choi go? thats stupid as hell... Also the drama is very simple and easy to watch! It has BOF OST \"Lucky\" love the song!!!! Overall drama is refreshing and enjoyable. Romance slowly trickles in so if you love character progression, this drama is for you. Entertaining drama. Comedy but not loud. All actors perfectly chosen and fitted in respective character. Anderson...Alexander ha, ha, ha. ... awaiting for next episodes. Inspirasing for Who want to open Chicken business... You know what\\'s the best part of this show? It\\'s the Chicken. While watching I can\\'t help but to drool over fried chicken..hahaha. I enjoy every scene and hopefully they extend it for 2 or more episodes. Dabin would surely enjoy this show....hahahaha. the title is like a pun tho. since the title could literally be translated to \"Choigo\\'s Chicken\" since Choigo is like the main chef of the chicken joint. omo this drama is so good!i loved every bit of it! First I was Hesitating to give it a try since I wasn\\'t familiar with the channel but now it feels like I have done a very good job in choosing this drama!! It\\'s Highly Recommended cause it\\'s light and sweet and will take all your stress out! Damn, I can\\'t wait for more episodes! Her \\'late\\' grandfather is very much alive. Was momentarily confused by the synopsis. 1st and got me hook especially with so-hye. hope wont fail midway..FIGHTING!!! Fighing, Seungjjang! Hopefully this will be the first of many. <3 Seung Hyub OMG, your first drama i can\\'t wait to see you! <3 fluttering alarm just ended in its episode 16 finale:))) Why isn\\'t it noted that this will replace 설렘주의보 (Fluttering Alarm/Love Alarm) in the MBN Wed-Thursday 11pm timeslot. Best chicken figthing!! woaaahh daebak!! this is her first comeback for the year 2018!! FIGHTING UNNIE!',\n",

       "  'comments': 'the only thing i don’t really like in the drama is that YJG has so much emotion but LSY not much especially for the last scene its lack of emotion. Congrats to all the cast. This is one of historical drama series I am satisfied with the ending. Every episode is really suspense. I like the story, all the twist and ideas of being a king. I’ll recommend to watch it. 5 star for me One of the best sageuks I\\'ve ever seen (my favorite remains Chuno aka The Slave Hunters) and I only wish it had been longer. Most sageuks are much longer than this one but this one deserved 20 episodes at least. Been watching Yeo Jin Goo since he was a little boy actor in 2005\\'s Sad Movie and he made me cry in that film so I knew his career would go into the stratosphere and I was proven correct. Good job to every single cast member, including the writer. The story line is intriguing ? Finished watching it today. so happy to have watched this one. wonderful characters; villains and heros alike. definitely a drama i’ll recommend to others. The final episode got me shookt. Too many happened that my heart was racing from start to the end. The ending is bitter sweet that makes this drama memorable and one of the best period dramas I\\'ve watched. The narration/caption told wonderfully at the end is the ribbon wrapping up this whole gift of journey in this drama series. Kudos to all actors, director, producer & staff. It really ends and I\\'m gonna missed them! Congratulations to all cast of The Crowned Clown, specially Yeo Jin-Goo (he never fail to amazed me) to the writer, director and all the crew! You give us a very satisfying drama to watch! Thank you, til next drama to watch! I thought that the golden age of great Korean historical dramas was behind us, but the \"Crowned Clown\" does honor to this tradition. It uses many of the familiar ingredients of historical dramas and tells us a new story extremely well. ok this might be an unpopular opinion but Dalrae just gets in my nerves, I know she’s just a clueless sister who’s yearning for her brother but she’s messing up everything and it just pisses me off to no extent, she’s gonna get everyone dead at this rate. like this one. Love this drama. Good job to everyone who is part of this kdrama. Amazing drama... Jin goo you did it again! Such a powerful presence... Kudos to all the cast and crew of this production! The drama has almost all elements one looks for in a drama. There is conflict, actions, betrayal, romance, love for friends and family, nationalism and a lot more but everything is well incorporated and well blended. There may be just a little of everything but one gets satisfied after watching it because of the actors\\' performances, the setting, the costumes, the lighting, the dialogs (I watch the subbed version) are all in place and help a lot in setting the mood. I am very impressed by the great quality of this fictitious historical drama in every way. It is wonderful story telling beautifully told. For all this time I thought Ha Sun was the little prince. Love this drama so much, yeo Jin goo and Lee se young acting is so good I Think, Jin Goo slayed this drama Wow....the plots are truly amazing...twist & turn at eact time & episode. Lee se young as the Queen is truly amazing...so much emotions is captured & potrayed by her eyes. From a sombre & silent pained face to a captivating & beautiful smile, then from a happy & hopeful in-love face to a disbelief & questioning face...she captured it all...slowly, silently & surely. Daebak. That is so subtle but truly great acting from her. As for yeo jin goo, kim sang kyung...nothing to expect except- the best...(as i have commented before). As for the rest of the casts...they’re all awesome...each & everyone of them made this drama a gem & worth watching. It\\'s getting all of the attentions it deserves. <3 Wow~ What a cliff-hanger! I like episode 11 so far, and also thanks for seeing more scenes from Queen So Woon??♥️ What a twisted historical drama she did not like the addictive king. Absolutely great drama. Yeo Jin Goo’s acting is superb. Well actually every cast is great, except for the queen, I hope it was someone else. It\\'s been quite a while since I watched a historical drama and I\\'m grateful to have picked The Crowned Clown. I have no words for this drama. So far it\\'s just so good I\\'m being left speechless each episode. It just gets better with every episode and the acting is flawless! There\\'s no bad acting. Yeo Jingoo really shows how much of a good actor he is in this drama! As expected, a great actor can play anyone, even if it means playing two characters that are actually the opposite of each other. He pulls off that feat perfectly. Kim Sangkyung\\'s acting is also immensely good that it gives me goosebumps. I sincerely hope the drama stays this good till the very end. I had known Jin Go as a child, he seemed promising. But I do not like it here, perhaps because it does not look like a man. I do not think is up to the double character, luckily it seems that the madman is dead, i think he does not have the beauty of other actors or the skill of Yoo Ah In. Disappointing the other actors, too stressful plot. I do not think I will continue it. Wow! Bravo to Jin-Goo! He portrayed the two roles very professional. What a great actor. Hands up to this man. Wish more project for him after this. So nice kdrama❤️❤️❤️ I am addicted to this drama. Ep 8 is so unpredictable. However, I dont expect that much for a happy ending. I love every detail of this drama, especially salute to the director of the photography and the music scoring. It’s just a twice a week drama but I feel like watching a blockbuster movie. Looking forward to watch the epic ending! oh so even though this drama is based on the movie but it is tearing into a lightly different direction, instead of having the real king return and the fake one exile, here we have the real king died in ep8, but I think it is a wise choice to let him die since he is beyond saving (addiction, delusional, mentally unstable...) he is just on his way to the destruction of himself and the hold country, he has big dreams but with his personality he won\\'t go far. Look like the identity of the fake king will be question for the next few episodes, good thing that le kyun stabbed him to create a scar since to check whether he is the real king or not the only way is to check that scar (no dna test in the old day). This is the turning point of the drama, can\\'t wait for next episode. I\\'m so addicted to this drama. Ep 8 ending is so heartbreaking. I want the clown to remain as the king but never thought that the real will be killed by his loyal \"servant\"... I love this drama so much more so because of Yeo Jin Goo. I really admire hi so much since I watched him In Moon Embracing the Sun. Love Lee Se-Young too. I really like her in The Gentlemen of Wolgyesu.. Good acting for everybody.. Episode 8, last scene between the ailing-addict-Prince and his Lee Kyu was so beautifully acted that it\\'s impossible not to feel sad for this horrible man. The level of regret, madness and drug-induced-irrational hatred was played by professionals who completely understood the work at hand. Bravo Creative Team. i\\'m in love with Court Lady Kim My favorite drama at the moment. Jin Goo\\'s acting is very amazing. He plays both characters so well. Se Young is great too, but I wished that they could have picked a different actress. She looks too old to plays the King\\'s wife. I wish the silly real king really dead. But it just my wish. Impossible korean drama is simple as that. After 8 episodes, this historical drama is appealing in every aspect. The director is excellent, the two screenwriters are also doing a great job in developing a credible story with complex and shifting political tensions and very different human beings. It was not obvious at the beginning, but the arc of the entire story is working out well. In fact this storytelling is better than in \\'masquerade\\'. congratsss yeo jingoo for achieving 9.5%!!!!!! i still remember the competitor from other drama (airing the same time) mocked circle rating to be so low, praising their bias to death for rejecting the role..mentioned about quality over quatity...so where is their bias drama rating right now?arent they going to say the same thing? btw congrats tcc and teams!!!!soon will break 2 digits Jin Goo, you did it again ... such a great actor. Very handsome too whatever facial expression you do, you still look good. Very impressive... I love this drama so much and the main actor and actress are awesome together. My most favorite queen!!! Her acting so greatttt!!! And yeo jin goo, who doesn\\'t know his skill, he always great since kid. He captured my heart at I miss you with eun hye & the moon embrace the sun Love this drama so much mostly because of Yeo Jin Goo. He is such an amazing actor and has a very good, modulated voice. I like his chemistry with Lee Se-Young. Such a nice couple. I love Yeo Jin Goo so much?. Lee Se Young always does an amazing job N I really like her chemistry with YJG ♥️♥️♥️ @KIngmuffien the ratings are actually high considering that this is a cable drama so it has limited viewers, so you basically need to pay a fee to watch this channel not like kbs, sbs or mbc which are public channels). This drama is totally awesome.The actors and actresses are playing their role perfectly.I watched hwayugi and totally impressed with Buja,so i watched lee se young\\'s drama.Her emotion is totally conveyed perfectly in the drama.I can feel this hurt and heartbreaking feelings when watching her as the queen also. Wow... what an impressive re-make of the movie Masquerade (which I adore). Yeo Jin Goo is killing it! He\\'s such a talented actor. I\\'ve seen nearly all of his work, and he\\'s easily one of my favorite actors. He doesn\\'t act the role, he BECOMES it -- I mean, just wow! Can\\'t wait for the next episode.I like this drama must watch...Love this drama Why the rating is low? This drama is so nice and the story is interesting. I watched this and following every episode. If you gonna watch this you wont regret it 100%. I think i am falling in love with YJG. His acting is so awesome!! very interested drama. Yeo Jin-Goo acting ability is amazing. Wow! Is this is another version of masquerade? im thrilled watching this drama..its a must watch one.YJG is amazing This is so interesting drama.. When i first saw the synopsis of the story I immediately watched the first episode.. More Period Drama please.. love this kind of drama. They did a good job with the movie masquerade. I can\\'t wait to binge this drama! FEB 26 is so far away! I wish there was a way that ratings could be inclusive of binge watchers. I love saeguk! I love Yeo Jin Goo since I’ve watched him in Moon Embracing the Sun. Since them I became a fun. A very good actor and good looking. Oh how I love his voice. Loving this drama coz of him. I have watched that insightful kid grew up into this marvelous and simply splendid young actor. Indeed, 16 episodes will definitely not be enough for me. Am I the only one who has that deep feeling of being proud of a baby brother? I am so so so proud of him. Lmfao Yeo Jingoo always abuse so many girls in this drama! Seriously? Doppelganger? So retarded... It\\'s even more sad that I was looking forward to this drama because of the lead actor who\\'ve always impressed me but doppelganger storylines are just retarded. Why not make them twins instead? Wow, It\\'s very good drama. Yeo Jin Goo is very excellent and amazing actor!!!! The best drama for mon-tue Wow... Daebak!!! Yeo jin goo in this drama is crazily daebak....what an actor! The first episode is really good The king when I saw the him, I\\'m so scared Serial version of MASQUERADE lee byung hun?? Yeo Jin-Goo as the King is creepy and easy to hate while as the clown Ha Sun you\\'ll feel sorry and root for him. He acted both characters very well and distinctly based on the first episode hopefully he\\'ll deliver consistently or exceed what he has set as standards for himself. Looking forward to the next episodes. I\\'m looking forward to double Jingoo!! Gonna enjoy the ride. First episode was awesome just as expected Please be a CLASSIC long length Korean period drama. be a CLASSIC long length Korean period drama. Please be a CLASSIC long length Korean period drama (50 or more episodes). This is probably the most high budget historical kdrama. I mean– Take a freaking GOOD LOOK at the teasers and the posters! Wow. This drama will be epic. Looking forward to it a lot:) masquerade drama version Damn just take a look @ D poster... D trailer.... D casts. This drama is a Must watch! OMG cast wait. Lee Se Young.....wow....hehe...that pretty zombie- in hwayugi. Jin goo has always been consistent in giving his best in all his dramas. Let’s wait for this....hwaiting...fighting Ruler of the mask?@yook0502 Same plot with Ruler? I will watch this because of Yeo Jin Goo. He is a great actor. I know he can make this drama great. @Popcorn and coke It\\'s clearly written in the notes that this drama is a remake of Masquerade aka Lee Byunghun\\'s movie. @Popcorn and coke It\\'s because it\\'s the drama remake of the movie, Masquerade. It\\'s obvious that it\\'ll be similar to the movie. Lol, similar plot with Lee Byung Hyun\\'s masquerade. Even the pretend king is named Ha Sun and is also a clown. But yeah, i will still watch this because its Yeo Jin Goo. Haha I know yeo jin goo will do great in this drama, he\\'s a grear actor he can pull off any character, fighting oppa! I\\'ve been your fan since Moon Embracing the Sun @Jay Zee i actually agree with @lol that they do not have anything similar (esp)as far as their acting goes. as to their appearance, look closely and you’ll see they actually do not look alike.. even kmj said it himself that those who have seen them upclose agree they do not look similar. Yeo Jingoo’s appearance is more... manly and very well chiseled.. @Jay Zee At first glance maybe, but when I do actually look at them, especially in motion, I just don\\'t really see it at all. Yeo Jin Goo\\'s features are actually far more defined and striking imo. they are working together again. Add Kim Min Jae on the cast since he looks like Yeo Jin Goo. @ujju Nothing to do with \\'Ruler\\', this is a drama remake of 2012\\'s film with same title \\'Masquerade\\' starring Lee Byung-hun & Han Hyo-joo, and the story was really different with \\'Ruler\\' from the synopsis, its kinda similar with drama \"Ruler\" which has kim sohyun n infinite L in it...

       "  'comments': 'This drama is worse than watching paint dry Amazing Drama, Love the acting of the main actress Lee Soo Kyung she’s so good!! nice drama, eager to watch the next episode. I bet that the kid who just appeared in ep 45-46 is san ha and soo hoo’s son. Again it was esther’s evil deed...the kid didn’t really die, she stole the child and gave it to that girl who just came in korea from US. Beautiful amazing drama /very interesting and exciting just cant wait for the new episode! Great Actor/Actresses???❤❤❤❤ I actually enjoy watching this drama a whole lot cuz the role of the leading actress is a fighter despite being a nice and gentle woman. Unlike other boring Dramas, the nice keeps being nice & stupid and the villain keeps on doing vicious stuff. This is good and I can\\'t wait for the next episode. Bravo! The writing and directing are terrible. Deer in headlights acting. Irrational plot. I never liked watching daily dramas because the writers tend to drag the story for so long until the very end however this one is completely different. The main leads are finding out the truth piece by piece already and it\\'s not even halfway through the drama series yet. I like this pace. I also like how San-Ha has a backbone and smartness to her. She connects the clues one by one. She\\'s no pushover female lead like I\\'ve seen in other daily dramas. Hopefully the writers won\\'t messed it up because I\\'m enjoying seeing the villains slowly being exposed and in panic. the leading actress needs more training. She was terrible in Father, I Will Take Care of You.... and has disappointed me in this too! I love it this drama How long will take the break because of the holiday? The writer of this drama, seem to love this kind of genre, amnesia and all sorts of birth secrets. The female lead is not that bad, have seen some of her previous work and she did well. This writer was the same writer for Smile Again, with pretty much the same concept and over 100 episodes. I normally, stop watching if get to intense and it makes feel distress. It’s not the main actress. She has been in many dramas for years. Let’s Eat, Soulmate.. it’s the writing. lead actress cannot act at all. Ha yeon joo should be the lead in this drama not this no talent lee soo kyung + ha yeon joo is 100000% more prettier than lee soo kyung. Stop watching this drama after a few episode. Worst acting especially the lead girl Sanha or whatever. Ok, SPOILERS I don’t understand why the acting is so bad. It must be the director or writer. Many of these actors have performed brilliantly in other dramas. The main lead actress Soo Kyung (Sanha) keeps acting cute but sorry to say it doesnt suit her coz she is old. Wish she will stop doing it. Esther you are devil witch Speaking of switch...as of, ‘make a believable same height’ & much more same face... remember Na Wang-Sik lol of the last empress?...And speaking of kang se na, don’t forget shin hwa kyung of secret and lies - she just won the most promising new actress...ha yeon joo should take some tips from both of them, she might save the casts who (to quote) ‘nobody can act in this drama’ & probably will win an award too. And the male lead Kim ji-woo looks like Jang seong-jo of the encounter except that the latter is a superb calm actor compared to the former’s frenzied frantic & unruly acting, tho’ his face saves the per episode day when he still or motionless in the camera. The plot seems promising tho’, forget the female lead, it’s always the antagonists who will save the day. this drama isn\\'t that bad for people to hating on it and i think the acting is on par with daily drama becuz to me this is how they typically are except still loving you of course which deserve far more recognition. Worst drama ever!!! Are they all new actors because nobody knows how to act in ths drama. Main girl has a face of \"duah what am i doing here whats my next line do i look at the camera?\" And her mother is the worst actress I\\'ve seen.... wasted and hour of my life i can\\'t get back. All positive reviews are fake and only because the main guy is cute but don\\'t be fooled it sucks hairy kdrama balls... yeah true esther jung gonna replace kang sena as a prime antagonist. huhu love this timeslot antagonist have envy and hatred Esther Jung gonna start so much damn drama on this new drama, the show has not even air yet and I already know I\\'m going to dislike her character, but the actress that portray her Ha Yeon-joo is gorgeous, but she is going to make Oh San-ha life hell once Kim Jin-woo (Lee Soo-ho) loses his memory and will take on new identity as Park Do-kyung and fall in love with Esther Jung...ugh. Left Handed Wife will be a very cut throat drama... Finally get to watch Kim Jin Woo on the small screen. Hope he get to sign the OST as well. He has a very sweet an soothing voice. He is really one of the underrated actor so far. Esther Jung , I want you to suffer haha I’m ready to watch this drama ♥️ eihhhh we have this kind of drama in my country... very same plot...the title is Kan Kukejar Cintamu.... can wait the new antagonist esther Jung wow i love esther kung',\n",

       "  'comments': 'My favorite dorama. Thumbs up!! Watched it for Ryota, I stayed for the great Story and lessons. Masaki Suda never disappoints me. Everyone is so good at acting. Also Ryotas acting skills have improved by so much❤️? suda sensei he\\'s such an amazing actor I watched already 6 episodes and can\\'t wait for the rest ... at first i thought he\\'s a psycho but nooooo he\\'s just helping the students to stop from being selfish and to start seeing the essence of things.I won\\'t talk about details such a great drama i doooo like it Watched the series today, finished 2nd episode. This reminds me of The Queen\\'s Classroom. Suda Masaki\\'s acting is superb as always ❣ @ E, this is the opposite of sociopathy and this amazing teacher here\\'s sacrificing himself in order to save and change these dumb af students for good so that they don\\'t keep making the same mistakes in the future. My heart aches for him but anyways, this drama is so good and their acting, especially Suda Masaki\\'s, is just super top notch. Definitely recommend There are so many of these dramas and films with this topic. Just finished watching 1-3 episodes, and can\\'t wait for next episodes?? Just started watching this and omg this is sooooo exciting to watch! and great acting by Suda as expected omg, the first episode is so intense!! The New GTO????// new intro of the newest kidS on the block im soooo excited rn????????? masaki suda + katayose ryota = the best drama ever!!! (☞ ͡ ͡° ͜ ʖ ͡ ͡°)☞ Loving it so far based on the first episode This reminds me of the French movie \"The Day of the Skirt\" (lit.) where the teacher, stressed by the attitude of her students, the separation from her husband and the negativity around her wearing skirts, takes the opportunity to hold her class hostage when a gun falls from a student\\'s bag. She uses this opportunity to finally teach her students in \"peace\" and to ask for a day where women can comfortably wear skirts. This movie was inspired by a real event in France. So Suda Masaki is going to play the bad guy here? Sounds interesting! Omedetou Gozaimasu Sudacchi for your first sensei role. I\\'m looking forward to it.The plot is interesting!',\n",

       "  'comments': \"How come it didn't end last night? Wad this extended? Why they changed their cast? if not for season 1 and the expectations from it, this is actually a rather good drama with all those court cases. Eventhough the story plot is bad...and a person from season 1 appeared as someone else...what a fatal....but I still watch because of Park Shin Yang. Out of this mess, he keeps doing his best. Still his acting is excellent. I respect him. Hope he will get better dramas or movies in the future. not what i expected:( From comedy to thriller, dafuq. After several minutes of watching, my head goes blank. What kind of nonsense is this??? Where are the same feeling like the previous season??? What kind of timeline is this??? If u watch this directly from the previous season, you'll feel really f**ked up I heard filming is being suspended due to Park's herniated disc that required surgery. Maybe that's why he was limping? I think the script was written without analyzing what was the key success of the first season. In the first season, the story matched the title: neighbourhood lawyer Jo Deul Ho. So this is the list: We watched corruption cases in the first season. The case we saw in actual news. People heart it, and Lawyer Jo is everyday's hero. Second, Mr. Jo is a neighborhood lawyer, he is funny, full of empathy to poor people. He was not a detective of dark murder story. This sequel really broke the fans'expectation. There had been many dark murder dramas. Mr. Jo, as in the mind of fans, definitely not for it. Third, a father. This role is gone also in the sequel. I find the first season more relatable Good drama. I ve never missed PSY dramas. His acting is superb n very natural...hope the ratings will increase. Hwaiting? Ko Hyun Jung's role looks damn evil...scary. jo dal hwan and lee mi do are quite good supporting cast members and should add some fun to this drama. Unfortunately, aside from Park Shin Yang, the previous main and supporting cast is not returning:( At most, we only get to see 'Hae Kyung' as a cameo. I hope the new batch is as good as the old batch. The old batch showed excellent acting skills, facial expressions, and chemistry ... down to the nitty-gritty. It was amazing (from the little girl to the adults to the seniors). This time they paired Park Shin Yang with a senior actress Go Hyun Jung, instead of a newbie like Kang So Ra. However, Kang So Ra did not disappoint. She nailed her role really well, like the rest! So is this a sequel or a prequel? Because I'm kinda confused when I watched it i waited so much for this! *-* Weehee! Can hardly wait. I love this series. I’m super excited for this one. The teaser is very different from the teaser of the 1st series. Ko Hyun-Jung, I Am In!!! no kang sora:o:( whyyyyyyyyyyyy I hope Kang So Ra will also be a lead in this ... I want more of their interactions. No kang sora???? Wooow Go Hyun Jung is back.. Can't wait for this drama.. Ko hyun-jung ssi, cant wait to see you again. To me you are the legend and Legends never die. O for Awesome! Too good thank Go Hyun Jung for accepting and for KBS making this happen. GHJ a national acting treasure so happy to wait until January 2019 for this.? yes I love ko hyun jung's acting.. fighting Will they have the same cast? I hope so:D OMGGGGGGG! One of my favorite drama. Same casts please huhuhu I hope the main team get casted again Yay loved this drama! Hope kang sora gets casted as well and hopefully she has a bigger role in this one! OMG YES LOVE THIS DRAMA THE LITTLE GIRL AGAIN PLEASE AND KANG SORA FIGJTING PLEASE LOVE LOVE Please Kang So Ra again Waiting for this for a long time..Hoping the new series is as good as the first.Park shin yang coming back convinces me it will be good.\",\n",

       "  'comments': \"@jessica...yeah i saw it being 120 episodes on another site, but these are double episodes per view...seeing episode 29 just dropped (episode 57-58) and the cats out of the hat now...Pil-Doo is exposed, Ji-Na's plans are crumbling but the minute, Poong-Do suspicion are coming to light, Hak-Kyu is knows of his familys wrong doings and Chung-Yi is finally taking a stand!...so i cant see this drama stretching for another 30 or so more double episodes per viewing according to the current storyline progression!!! and if they do, it will drag on so much that it will be SOOOOOO annoying to watch...ESPECIALLY Deok-Hee and her antics for her pathetic daughter!!....Im with sf....i watched 29 episodes of This drama is unsupportable. 90% of characters are bad people and 10% are too weak and foolish to take the proper measures against the bad people. There isn't a balance among the bad things and good things, that is why this drama becomes annoying. Only bad things are happening. If that will continue, I don't think this drama will be watching any further. LAWL It's a Makjjang i.e Korean daily Soap Operas. It's 120 Eps at least. @wwe the drama is not just 15 eps it's 120 eps. OMG....just realised its only 15 episode season!!! WTF episode 12 and 13 just dropped and it feels like this story is half way to a (like) mid-season climax!!! and with only 2 episodes left at 35 mins each...i feel like the ending has to be rushed or they're going to give us a second season cliff hanger?!? ok just watched episode 11...and now its getting interesting with everyone back in town after a long break from each other. So the plot thickens with Beak Joon released from prison, gold digging Jin-Na in town, unknown fake portrait about to be exposed to the public, Pil-Do out to silence his past crimes and Chuang-Yi's past memory resurfacing. Throw in romance and comedy and you got a receipe for an interesting drama....my downfall in this drama is Poong-Do acting is getting abit annoying with too much Jim Carey facial's...other than that...its dropped to 8/10 for me:) Glad to see Lee So Yeon in a transformational role. She will always be remembered as the evil consort queen in Dong Yi, yet, I can see why she was chosen for this role. She has the acting skills, and those big, big eyes - so fitting for her character. yeah love this drama so far....great cast and good story/plot...what i like about this drama is that is got ALOT of puzzle pieces that will piece together for a grand story...unlike other dramas based on korean fables, this drama is straight forward with out googling the core of the story (like Mama Fairy and the Woodcutter)...its relatable to modern day love crisis without any supernatural/mythical beings or powers (besides the MC's reverse colour sight)...but this romcom drama has got potential...just hope they dont drag it out too much or rush it too quickly!! 8.5/10 (up to eps.4) what a great start!. guess I found my daily to watch. sad to see jae hee in minor role lately... hope this is drama will make korean people opened their eye to see how talented this guy is. I waiting Jae Hee oppa as main cast in kdrama for so long. So i gonna start to watch kdrama again. OK i`m trying but cant see anything in the synopsis that suggests this is based on The Tale of Shim Chong ...nada not a thing I hope this will be a good drama I am soooo excited for Jae Hee’s comeback as the lead actor!!! Will definitely watch this!\",\n",

I can\\'t believe it\\'s the end it\\'s happy ending but nooooo I want more seriously the best kdrama in 2019 the best family drama...this drama made me angry, cry and laugh... Bull. Really bad guy have contracts on people’s organs? You can save yourself by paying? Bad guys just take them. There is far too much suspension of disbelief. And the lying about the ex wife being able to give for the benefit of the daughter. Someone is smoking weed here. The male lead was much better in the land. Still only three characters anyone would want to cheer on and they aren’t among the five siblings. This drama is getting better, love it. Ratings also much better now. Fighting!!! Fighting poong-song. Truly Amazing drama I don’t think the particulars are known by all with the younger brother. Best drama seen ever!Congratulation to the actors,the screenwriter and to the one who chose the song for the soundtrack!I hope this drama is rewarded. This drama is frustrating that reveals the reality of life.. This drama shows all the annoying people that exist and put into one annoying drama.. I understand why all people hate this drama but I think it shows how we can learn from the mistakes they are doing.. Its pretty sad that people from all over the world are like this and don’t care about other people and some are just greedy for things.. This drama helped me learn about the real life and that life isn’t always perfect and that love can ruin other people... i hope people can learn from this and not hate the drama.... Com\\'on people! Let\\'s forget all the stupid things this drama does from the past previous episodes, from the stupid Poong Sang to the most stupid younger sibling Hwa Sang.. In the last episodes i cried a river! How can people be so cruel and without mercy for a family member who sacrificed alot just for their sake! Such a great cast, when viewers start to hate the siblings that \\'s the best prove of the outstanding performance...thumbs up to them all??? Is the rating percent changes interesting. It’s clear it’s not just viewers abroad having issues with this drama. I wanna jump in the tv to slap them?...poong-sang sibling is wrong but he is wrong too it\\'s too clearly that he just care about jung-sang but he not admit it? and i want he tell the truth about their mother( x layak dipanggil mom pun?) for the first time i hate all character in drama but fell sad for them? For the first time, i hate almost all character in one drama. This drama has annoying, all character are annoying. I stop watching this, this drama makes me angry all the time. I hate, sooo hate all character. Sigh... New idea for ending. The five siblings, mom, nosey neighborhood lady, father in law and pregnant lady are all in the same building and a sink hole swallows it up. So sad. Boon sil wins the lottery, rich girl and doctor husband marry and have six kids. Wow, these people are terrible. Boon Sil is the only redeeming character. Very depressing story... I\\'m just curious how the ending unveils the tangled story. Power cast helps me survive watching this drama. Oops Boon Sill, Yeol Han and Joon Yi are fine. So everyone meets an early end except those three would be an ideal ending. I’ve never disliked so many in a drama before. Is the only person of character Boom Shill? Can the writer just end all the characters in an accident. I do not think I am wanting any of them to survive let alone the main lead. Every role in this drama has their own miserable life and it\\'s frustrated me. I\\'m curious how this will end.. I\\'ll be mad if that brazen Jin Sang eventually would kill Poong Sang. This drama frustrates me and I\\'ve never found any awful and suffocating drama other than this, just yet. Gosh. Wow!! This drama is just ridiculous, painful, and torture. Don\\'t watch it and save yourself from watching an awful drama. I started this drama because I am a huge fan of Lee Si Young and am regretting it. I\\'m now 26 episodes in and hate it! There is not a single thing worth mentioning. I thought Love Alert was bad but this may even be worse.:( And don’t ever make chil bok pants ripped ever again, iys not even funny anymore! You better make their mom go to jail or dead!!! And please do not make chil bok pants ripped ever again, it is not even funny anymore! You better make their mother go to jail or dead soon!!!!!!! For the writer in this drama Moon Young Nam, can you please change all the characters of them? I never once been so upset watching drama before. It feels like i want to slam and broke down my TV. it is not normal to have all the crazy character in one drama, you need to fix it all real soon or your rating will go down!! For the first time, i hate all character in one drama. But i continue to watch because i want to know what happen at the end. I wish happy ending, if not it will be 0/10. But i still believe it will be happy ending after all pain and suffer in their family. I love the story,, kudos to the writer and actors as well,, i really cried a river??? i feel bad for pongsang but thats life u cant choose ur family u just have to embrace and accept the fact that nobodyr perfect,, having him as a brother is really a blessed guys? how i wish i have one ahh!!! I really hate poongsang, bad husband and father Technically the parents usually collect the money. Guests give to the side of the family they are connected to. The odd thing is for the money handlers to hand it to a woman claiming to be mom. It’s a massive amount. Parent shave been giving money to support their kids well into adult lives. Well honestly, I started getting bored of this drama but it seems more exciting episodes are coming....if you are pissed of the villain(mother) it means they did well in their role. I stopped watching on ep. 15. this drama is so frustrating. watching Pongsang apologize to his wife for several time on the same mistake. I cant tolerance people like that. and the most horrible in this drama is The devil mother. I thought Taiwanese dramas are bad but this take the cake!! Anything bad that can happen really happens here, unbelievable; from 1st bro lost money to being gigolo, 2nd sis had affair with married man to marrying the man who jilted her, 3rd sister who at 35yrs still cant find a job & spunge off guys, youngest bro involved with gangsters & eldest daughter doesnt want to go to school & PS pays for his bros /sister\\'s debts even to stealing from his wife. I mean how bad can it get & now only episode 16. I wont be watching until the end as I know more bad things are coming. I don\\'t know if I can sit thru 13 more hours of this. Mother steals daughter\\'s wedding money? Like I didn\\'t see that coming. PS is a POS to his wife and daughter. JS is a POS to PS. I wish they\\'d just fast forward to the part where PS needs surgery and none of his blood siblings want to help him. WS would help but he\\'s not blood related. The FIL is just as greedy as the siblings. As is the MIL to the eldest daughter. Money money money is all that matters. How can the brother manhandle her constantly and the mom constantly in public and never get arrested? The FIL is why the wife tolerates this guy. He is awful. The brother is why the sister likes the ex husband who is a drunk. I think there is more to the story there. Why doesn’t the police evict people? Why is it a gang of thugs? Nobody is modeling good character at all. poongsan is extremely selfish! the drama potrayed him to be kind etc, but when father in law ask for eating beef or teeth implant, he doesnt bother. He doesnt want to live with father in law who is old, rather he tryin so hard to keep his siblings together, even want to open clinic for his sister. He doesnt hesitate to spend big money for paying useless debt or any trouble siblings done. Throw the eldest brother in prison. Why the heck can’t a 35 year old live and work where she wants? Are there no police in Korea to arrest a man manhandling a women in public? What is wrong with where the sister is staying. The lot of them are going to be evicted. They need to relocate. How four adults under one rood can’t manage I’ll never know. I just checked, this drama is written by the same writer of another awful painful drama, Our Gabsoon. Unfortunately this time no Solim couple and hot kissing scenes to create some buzz to get more views online.zzz. Why does the sister need/want surgery? Why does the other sister’s medical clinic mean more to the brother than what she needs? Why must everyone live in city? The eldest who has been supporting the lot doesn’t have a college degree. Why can’t the rest without a degree do so? Why does the sister doc have such a large apartment? Why is the father in law a jerk, is it to make it realistic that she would stay with her husband longer? Why would a 42 year old need to live off his brother since age 24? His sisters since age 17. Cut the cord. The “affair” was a total con. Is Korea really so bad to orphans? I like that there\\'s more to the siblings that their fickleness, which is gonna drive me crazy!! PoongSang needs to grow a pair tho... How his wife has put up with him is beyond me!! This drama is really awful. Why did song jong ho sign up for this mess? And this is you called drama... Unlike those KBS mostly have in the early morning time or weekend time.. What? Changing face? Loosing child? Changing kids? Inheritance? Stupid Cupid love? They maybe for some reasons entertaining but just makes us a fool.. If you spend a lot on hard working and financial then making a.good scene that would both entertaining and educating, then you have achieved and nothing is going in vain... Holy Cow. So from the title of the show, PS will probably need a liver transplant and none of his siblings will want to do it for him after all he\\'s done for them. Every one of the siblings has issues. PS makes his wife and daughter miserable over them. Wow...is that Ahn Nae-Sang as gangster husband? Hahaha...almost didn\\'t recognize him. this is the best drama so far strong story+cast just <3 it This drama is solid with the cast and acting! The storyline is absolutely hilarious at one point then emotionally wrought the next. It’s unpredictable and that is just in the first 2 episodes. This scriptwriter has a knack for creating endearing characters and story. I’m having a ball watching. However the introduction of Jo Young Pil I’m not feeling her character so hopefully I’ll warm up to her because Lee We Sang is like whoa where did he come from? He is extremely gorgeous and whenever he appears nothing else matters. I love everything about this drama so far. JS and HS are totally annoying...hope they will eventually mend their ways. Wow, this is quite the cast! Looking forward to how the story unfolds and how each character connects with one another. the famous actors and actress in one drama?? Woow!! The crew indeed geat to bring them in one drama , since usually people cast them as first lead or second lead. lee si young drama i will watch for sure!!!!!!! she is best in comedy this show seems to be family mixed comedy drama i missed lee si young soooooooo much excited to her back again in another drama hope she has more screen presence n more scope in acting to, love her to bits So excited! Lee Siyoung in a family drama is going to be awesome. are they real siblings of poong sang or adopted ones Cant wait to see Oh Ji Ho, the name \"Jin Sang\" mean bad guy in korean haha Yeesss oh ji ho oppa nice is there any romance in drama it\\'s long time to see lee siyoung again in family drama after valid love... Finally get to see Jeon Hye Bin in the role of a doctor. After seeing her in \"Heart Beat,\" a variety show, I thought she would be excellent as a doctor in a drama as she shows her compassion, talent, professionalism, and leadership. Great cast for \"What\\'s Wrong Poong-Sang! Look forward to this family drama in January, 2019! I\\'m kinda looking forward to Yu Jun-Sang playing a put-upon middle-aged loser clucking over a bunch of wayward siblings. And Oh Ji-Ho as his younger brother?! Well call me shallow but that\\'s TWO super-ripped ahjusshi for me to look forward to! Who cares if there\\'s romance or not. It\\'s not a pre-requisite for a good drama as long as it\\'s entertaining, well acted and well executed. It looks more like a family drama than a pure romance. Not saying there won\\'t be any romance since family dramas usually come with romance as well, but it won\\'t be the main focus I believe. confused is they are all are siblings then who are they paired up with..i mean is there any romance in this drama? but excited to see lee si young back ..',\n",

This is the saddest story ever, I will hope for a hapoy ending since tte manga was open ended. (And although I love Shuhei-kun it is suuuuper hard to win over Masaki Okada and Inoue Mao's version) This one might be amazing, the movie adaption with Inoue Mao is still one of the best tear jerkers to ever get produced in japan.. Sakurai Hinako is a force to be reckoned with among the young fresh actresses and Shuhei is arguably top 5 actors for his age group. As a bonus Honoka Miki is back, i havent really seen her in anything decent since Itazura Na Kiss cast is super great but I have a feeling it won't make me cry like the original, mao and okada masaki's acting and chemistry were so good OMGGG..? i'm so excited? oohhh when I saw the picture on instagram I was wondering how it looks similar with I Give My First Love To You movie poster and turns out its the drama version!!! omgg shuhei nomura so looking forward to it~ hinako sakurai is also such a uprising new talented actress. hope the drama goes well! ganbatteee\",\n",

I just wish that the ending wont turn out like chugakusei nikki. this is like the best japanese drama with the best actors.. i'm crazy for it The 2 episodes so far seemed pretty good and enjoyable! I normally dislike Love triangles but dang— this one has a love SQUARE. Anyways, I'm pretty excited for the next episodes and hopefully subbers won't give up on the drama midway as it usually happens with J-dramas:,) Dang kyoko hit jackpot by playing with 3 ikemen..

       "  'comments': \"to be honest, ı didnt like first 3 episode.. sexuality and harassment were at the forefront and wait what? no way , why accept my favorite actor(Park Sİ Hoo) this drama? no style him? but 4/5/6/7/8 and now 9 episode incredibly beautiful so intense Awesome drama and very intense screenplay. Emotional rollercoaster. Fan of this drama from very episode 1. This keeps getting better and better by every episode . Simply exceeds expectations. Not to mention, Cast is fantastic. The girl looks like park bo young? this drama is just awesome; the plot is perfect so much twist turns make me always wonder what going to happen next; hope this goes well and not get borring at the middle also park shi hoo and jang hee jin are perfect for this maybe they was fit more for melodrama than a romcom i honestly didn' t like shi hoo on his previous drama lovely horribly I am fan of Jang Hee-Jin. I really her mind blowing performance in this drama. Watching just for her. She is not only elegant and ethereal but also talented. Loving this drama series so far. Jang Hee-Jin is killing it in her role. Kim Ji-Hoon is being killed off way too soon. I hated seeing him as a villain cause I love the actor.. They could have had him in a few more episodes would have been all right with me.. I do like the drama so far. I am also a big fan of Park Si-Hoo. This drama seems to have a lot of twists and turns. Oh my gosh!!! Loving this drama! So many twists! Cannot wait for more episodes to come out! yeahhhhh interesting plot... The end of the first episode leave me with a big question mark? Like how come? So i'm excited to watch the next episodes. I expect this drama to be exciting and interesting ...the actors and actresses are known for their good acting. I just started watching episode 1.I'm really really so many loved .. mystery and suspense! Park Si Hoo and Babel Fighting! She's one of my favorite actresses and I was excited to see her as the lead, but not with that counterpart. This is a huge disappointment. I am really looking forward to this series and hope it's gonna be spellbound. PSH is one great actor who gives any role he portrays his best! ....Always! Carpe Diem! Fingers crossed... please don't waste Kim Hae-Sook Jan 27 will start, Fighting Sihoo and Babel I will definitely watch it for Jang he Jin. she is phenomenal actress but underrated. I will definitely support her by watching all her dramas. All the best unnie. When will it be aired.... I am so eager to see its first episode. @Ginali What do you mean the first time she's playing a female protagonist? She's had a few tho and if you were meaning to say her first time playing a female lead, well this is her second time I will watch this because of Park Sihoo, he is an amazing actor Must watch film, sound interesting of PSH. Love PSH fighting Wow. For the first time jang hee jin become a female protagonist! Gotta watch this That synopsis!!! I must watch!!! Oppa glad to see you working hard!! congratulations oppa, looking forward.. fighting Im kinda confused with the Synopsis OMG. But ill watch this because of Park Si Hoo Oppa.\",\n",

Highlight for Ju Ji Hoon and Kim Sung Kyu what incredible performances! Looking forward to more ... It can compare to Train to Busan wow is to much blood.. to gory! but i like it???? Is it too gory? Great Korean drama! All actors played there roles for 100%! Someone have any info about 2nd season? What the hell happened after that I think the writer of this drama likes the movie or the story of the sinking of the TITANIC in 1912 so much. If you know what I mean.??? @hyorainie - That actually makes sense! Although it\\'s just speculation now but it makes sense as to why the professor seems so skilled at killing zombies. As for the crown prince\\'s right hand man and your theory about that I\\'m not sure he would want his wife and child to be put in that situation. There is a huge possibility that he\\'s bad but I don\\'t think his intentions were to get his child to become king because that means they would have to kill his wife to keep her quiet... right. He could have been bribed or threatened? to rat on the crown prince. This series is sooooo good... I cant wait for season 2 already. Although we need to wait a year but as long as it\\'s worth it. Is there season 2? @stars: I have so many questions! I really love this series and I\\'ve been waiting for season 2 hope it will be soon. Too good, it\\'s really good even better than train to Busan and scarier. Looking forward to the season 2 Why is everybody talking about seasons??? This series is gold, I can\\'t wait for 2nd season!!?? Watched the trailer months ago on bae Donna\\'s ig. Wasn\\'t expect much but it turns out to be amazing. Can\\'t wait for season 2 already This exceeds my expectation..it\\'s too good. 1000/10. Even scarier than Train to Busan or any sort of zombie movies What an incredible start to the season in Kdrama industry. The production design, the costume design, the cinematography and the editing are top notch on this drama. Kudos to the Art director and the costume designers especially, it really animates historical Korea in an amazing manner. The show\\'s full of political as well as visceral tension. The 6th episode ending was shocking, I cannot wait for more. This is an engaging and beautifully crafted series=== walking dead meets game of thrones.....Why only 6 episodes in series 1????I only hope they can continue with the pace and intensity in series 2. This is beyond what I expect, cinematography is on point, the production team really invest their time and effort to create such superb quality of scenes. Great plot and a lot of mysteries. I find this series incomparable with Walking Dead and Fear the Walking Dead..... I can\\'t wait for the season 2. Superb!!!! I hope it will be continued season 2. We want the season 2 so bad right away please! Re-watching it again. Now in english dub. Kingdom is so fripping!!! All the actors are great! Thanks Netflix. Please air Season 2 already:) It\\'s really a good drama. It has a great storyline but OMG that major cliffhanger at the end of episode 6 really got me like \"What?! That\\'s it?! Nooooo?\". I hope season 2 will come around soon. ❤ The cast is just fine as it is, as the characters grown and bloom over this season. When it came to that Netflix had commissioned a sageuk, I was more than ecstatic! I LOVE my sageuks more so than contemporary Kdramas and grab them from anywhere, anyhow. However, I don’t care for the ones with kumihos, and when is the episode 7 or the season 2? Why is the sentence „in remembrance of GO geunhee at the end of the episode? Hello, WTH...so when is season 2??? Can\\'t believe it\\'s really the ending. Waiting for the season 2!! I am only on my third episode, but wow, I enjoy this more than the Walking Dead. I\\'m on edge of my seat all the time. I love it! I have just finished binge-watching \"Kingdom\" and I am totally awed! What a cliffhanger of a season finale, huh? Argghhh omds LOVE IT! don\\'t know if this show success or not but Netflix got me hooked for sure. guess 20 eps and below are ok but when a series get too long it starts to get boring, I know kim eun hee from \"signal\" which I watched awhile back on tvn, that was a good one too. hope we\\'ll get to watch season 2 in the fall of this year but to ensure the quality of the show I don\\'t think they gonna rush it. Hey there, Daebak!!! I like this better than the walking dead,. I hope there will be season 2,.????? Netflix doing this to keep us waiting so that we have to keep renewing our subscription until next year to watch season 2. I decided to watch this again since I was skipping a lot of scenes while watching the 1st time, and there are questions that keep popping up while I watch this show SPOILER ALERT: I have enjoyed zombie films/series for a very long time, and I think I just found a new top favorite. This series is incredible in so many aspects, from the unpredictable action packed scenes (that you don\\'t usually see in Korean television) to the amazing political drama that Korean entertainment always excels in. It was so dark, cool, made you traumatic to eating soup lol but I like it! I adore Ju Ji Hoon and Bae Doo Na. But wHy season 2 will be air in the next year, wHy?! Not the worst but really nothing special! Korean dramas are usually nice and complex, this is plain and stupid with no character development! Don\\'t go down the same commercial shithole as the U.S. decided to and keep trying to produce locally I really enjoyed it. Zombies aren’t my cup of tea but I still enjoyed the story and thought all of the casting choices were on point. It was boring, cruel and pointless. Zombies...I have seen too much this kind of nonsense already. when is season 2???? I love it but it\\'s Too Short .. Well season 2 will be in production started February 2019, so we are expected to see it by 2020 since it took more than a year to finish season 1. Six episodes isn\\'t enough to conclude the drama, I think there is more room for development so making another season ( probably 6 eps) would be a good idea. There are still a lot of questions such as someone is tipping off info to jo hak joo and something like this happened before, and I think an hyun probably involved some how for he knows how to fight the zombies even without anyone inform him about the epidemic. I think that they did this before to the other kings but in this case it got out of control. The queen isn\\'t pregnant and she is trying to find a baby boy and make him King since the king will only be a puppet King. This is a good drama, good story line, good acting, and not a moment of boredom, can\\'t wait for season 2. Please tell me that there will be season 2. Finished watching this and feels like it still unfinished yet. There are so many unanswered questions.. and that freaking cliffhanger on the end of eps 6 tho.. idk what to say. 6 ep? Please drop season 2 already.? Great concept, but really 6 episodes? Felt like the show was just starting, should have gone for regular 12, 16 or 20 episodes. i like Ju Ji Hoon\\'s so much. he really good on acting. wow its been released on Netflix super excited:D I have goosebumps watching the trailer. The zombies look like the fast, insect-like ones from Train to Busan and World War Z. I absolutely cannot wait! Nice addition Netflix. zombies in Rampant movie? Haha LOL Doona is the most important reason that makes me expect this drama, she is a unique Korean actress. I love this actress who is beautiful even without makeup WoW.... 6?! Turn on Netflix because of this one of a kind actress, Doona Bae Cant wait. Ju jihoon. The SOUND is no joking!! Its Netflix Finally Ju ji-hoon is back....can\\'t wait this drama❤ Ju Jihoon? Bae Doona? I\\'M IN I\\'M IN! These two have been so amazing for years and now they\\'re in one frame with the intriguing plot plus it has zombies, it\\'s a big YES. Horse to Busan <3 this is gonna be sooo goood im gonna dieeeee! sadly only 6 episodes TT_TT OMG. Doona Bae. I love her! She is a unique Korean actress Doona Bae == MUST WATCH! What an amazing actress! So much talent. I might have to get netflix if they are going to start producing Kdrama with this kind of talent! oh ho, there actually exists someone who doesn\\'t like Doona bae, she\\'s a very good actress,for though who have not watch her before should give it a try, she played in a bunch of US movies, try \"cloud atlas\", or \"stranger\" ...for though who have not watch any of her drama or films, you should watch first before judging her, though who watched her already and still don\\'t like her then you sure have some unique taste. can\\'t wait for this drama, good thing I have Netflix account. @ivi DUUUDE! @ivi_lativi well you must be a beginner in korean cinema.. bae doona is a actress from south korea who play in many korean hit movies such as hthe host and the 2017 hit drama stranger a,k,a secret forest and hollywood box office including jupiter ascending and cloud atlas (she\\'s playing with tom hanks) I cannot wait for this drama!!! THE CAST IS GREAT! omg Bae Doo Na!! YES!! I love her so much!! the whole cast really!! But BDN is just yaaassssss! I\\'ve heard that almost 20 mil dollars are invested in this drama and the cast is great so I\\'m sure it won\\'t disappoint me. Why this drama took so long to be release when it just tiny episodes of 6 episode?! @ivi_lativi: Do not be stupid like that, you may not like her and that is your personal opinion but disappointed about BDN -> I just laugh. BDN is not only loved by fans but also recognized by Korean, Japanese producers and even Hollywood directors. She is not pretty, she is just beautiful, cool, badass and unique. And finally, do not forget BDN is Netflix\\'s girl:)))) @ivi_lativi: Do not be stupid like that, you may not like her and that is your personal opinion but disappointed about BDN -> I just laugh. BDN is not only loved by fans but also recognized by Korean, Japanese producers and even Hollywood directors. She is not pretty, she is just beautiful, cool, badass and unique.

And finally, do not forget BDN is Netflix\\'s girl:)))) @ivi_lativi: you are so humorous haha. Bash Doona Bae is the stupidest thing i ever heard @ivi_lativi How dare you complaint about Bae Doona? Bruh do some research! Only people living under the rock would be disappointed in her role. I was happy because there is ju jihoon oppa. But the female lead:( i am dissapointed with the female lead.. But i hope this drama will good and nice to watch the plot of story dramas. My only complaint about this drama is that there\\'s only gonna be 6 episodes. I need more. It seems like it\\'s gonna be a great drama. My Netflix account & I can\\'t wait for this one I cannot wait for this series! So excited for this one? Im super exited!!! Oppa ju ji hoon welcome back!!!! Is this zombie drama like train to busan??? wonder which crown prince? circa time? Bae Doo-na, means i\\'m watching this one. Wow, the cast! This more looks like a movie than a drama, the director (movie director: A Hard Day & Tunnel) and the writer (Signal) was incredible. The cast also doing more movie than drama nowadays, especially for Ryu Seung-ryong, i don\\'t know he still accept drama project. Plus netflix will join this, simply amazing. A drama with a movie vibe Ryu Seung Ryong and Heo Jun Ho in the same drama... plus Bae Doo Na... it\\'s gonna be like an acting masterclass... Netflix\\'s girl. My badass, Doona <3 Joo ji hoon oppa please accept . I really miss youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu Cant wait... I Love kim eun hee chakkanim Can\\'t wait for this!!!!!! Can\\'t waitttt >.< Please add lee je hoon as main lead,, he is really great actor ..fighting for kingdom Wow, can\\'t wait for it. I really like all of Kim Eun Hee projects ^^',\n",

       "  'comments': 'loved this drama. left me so happy. only complaint was how Dan-i\\'s daughter was written away in the show. Would have loved to see her as a mother AND have a romance with Eun-ho! loved this drama. left me so happy. only complaint was how Dan-i\\'s daughter was written away in the show. Would have loved to see her as a mother AND have a romance with Eun-ho! I loved this Kdrama an I want to read this book. I loved Kang Dan-i and Cha Eun-ho relationship just beautiful. I am sorry this series is over. Just a show/drama but their are real life lessons truly. I’m sad to say that I’ve finished Romance is a Bonus Book. Man oh man was it a roller coaster filled with many emotions. The ending was perfect and beautiful! This drama has encouraged me to read books more, I’ve even thought about my future. Maybe I want to work at a book publishing company? I thank each and every person who helped make this show possible. I want to thank Lee Jong-suk for helping me make it through the each week so that I could get to the weekend. I fell in love with him the second he came on screen, his charming but warm smile and sweet actions made me fall in love. Thank you for blessing my eyes and ears with such talent from all of the actors/actresses. I look forward to seeing what everyone accomplishes in the future! Much love!? Besides love, this drama also inspires you to love the book. The best kdrama ever, each character have a nice ending. Totally a worth watching!!! I will read more book ❤ Just finished the last episode and it\\'s one of the few korean dramas, that leaves you feeling warm and filled with joy. It has interesting and fun characters which are quirky yet very real. It isn\\'t overly dramatic , which was a breath of fresh air. The comedy was also done extremely well. All in all loved this drama and for people who love reading books , this one will be more special. Each character\\'s story is resolved in a beautiful way. I just finished the drama and wow! The last episode is one of the best endings for kdrama ever! Every single character had their storyline wrapped up except one person.... Kang Dan-Yi child. Where did she go!? Is the father taking care of her? Is she getting raised by nuns? At the beginning of the story, the writer used Kang Dan-Yi pitiful background (divorced, cheated on, child, unemployed, etc) to gain sympathy for her character. Then completely forgot she had a child and Kang Dan-Yi and Chan Eun-Ho live happily ever after(as if she if didn\\'t have a child). Anyways that\\'s my only major complaint and I loved everything else about the drama. I’m obsessed with this show! I’ve never watched a kdrama before but I think I will. Really hope there will be more episodes because I can’t get enough of it. In love with LJS and his character in the show. Honestly LNY’s character annoyed me at the start but I’ve warmed to the character, her acting is great throughout. Hope Hae-rin and Seo-jun’s relationship develop too. Great show, praying there will be a second season! It\\'s so boring omg... I always have to fast forward and keep yawning whenever I watch it. I\\'m trying to suffer my way through it because I already wasted too much time to just stop half way. Lee Jong Suk always acts in dramas with really cool story lines, but this was just a bad choice. Im a huge fan of LJS and this is my first time to comment in this type of RomCom that ive watch all the time. Being a huge fan of kdramas this story makes me feel related im an avid fan of books in any genre which makes me feel inlove and inspired when i watched this a very much fresh kind of love story which is a woman is much older to a man and the love story soothes my emotions very touching. And every episodes i never missed out and it tickles to my heart.i cant wait the twisted side of story which hopefully song hae rin and ji seo joon will fall in love. I cant wait to watch the next two episodes keep it up fighting!! I love modern and progressive approach of this drama a lot. This is the first time that I watch Lee Na Young: she is just breath-taking. One of the most beautiful Korean woman I have ever seen. Also her acting skills are rather impressive. I saw every drama of Lee Jong- Suk and he has always been very good at romantic scenes. But this is the first time that I see him playing with that much passion as if he is really in love with Lee Na-Young. So different than the previous works. It is a joy to watch their love-bird moments. I love this drama. The actors and actresses make this worth watching for. Can\\'t wait for the coming episodes.. It seems that I will watch this all over again.. Good job guys! You did a very awesome and excellent show! Love it!!!! @Jen: It\\'s Meeeee ... With You this is a nice drama and all actors are doing a great job. though it feels simple, warm and easy to watch it touches a serious and not so easy subject with very serious implications in current soth korean society and i am a little amazed by the fact that most of the comments only talk about the love stories and chemistry and how cute one or another character is. I really shipped Song Hae Rin and Ji Seo Jun!!! Who\\'s with me?? Huge fan of LJS. Seen all his work. This and W are my fav. Amazing show. Love their chemistry. First time watching LNY. She is great. Always hard to go through a long week to wait for sat and sun for this show. Will miss it. Will miss him. LJS: Oppa saranghe❤️❤️ as i watched this drama, i was kinda worried how the transition would be when eunho confesses his love for dan-i knowing that the latter really shows no romantic interest on him. But eunho made it so cool, the age gap just didnt affect at all. And dan-i can really rely on eunho. As usual jongsuk on kdrama is the ultimate noona magnet. Lee jong suk made this drama still worth watched I get tired of trying to read and see photos of what\\'s going on, but I love this show, more than any I\\'ve watched for a long time. I get excited every time I see that there\\'s a new episode. Already I\\'m looking forward to and dreading the last episode. Top rating from me. lee na young is very suitable as kang dan-i. i love her acting. fyi, LNY is LJS\\'s favorite actress. i love everything in this drama. the actors, acting, plots, scoring, soundtracks, scenario, etc. lee na young n lee jong suk have such a natural acting. sooo sooo natural. I fell in love with this show, and I truly love the story but I am worried. Is this series meant to have multiple seasons? Or are we just going to have one season that ties everything together? New to Korean. I do not even understand the language. I am from India. I\\'ll be very honest. Just happened to watch the trailer as I was feeling bored and browsing netflix. Never did I know would end up liking the show and also writing a comment. The hardships Kang Dan-Yi goes thru after her divorce being a single mom raising a kid and getting back on foot with a job. Every character is woven neat and have their rightful presence with the story. Waiting for the suspense about April 23. Hope the story gets more and more interesting in a great way. Awaiting next weekend episodes. I am a Lee Jong Suk fan. He is a natural when it comes to his acting. Pinnochio, one of his best and W. But, I am a bit disappointed with this drama. The producers could have chosen a better female lead. Park Shin Hye is cute and they balanced each other so well. Han Hyo Joo - well what can I say. Look at all the actors she\\'s acted with since Shining Inheritance, Dong Yi, etc. I get it, this is a nuna vs dongsaeng but she just looks wrong for him. I watched one episode and I kinda of wonder, what makes the producers cast her against LJS? She must have some connections. Son Ye Jin she is not. Jung Hae In has a baby face but Son Ye Jin somehow don\\'t look out of place acting with him. This female lead, she is neither pretty nor cute nor quirky ... what a shame. I have been waiting for LJS romance drama since W, one with a happy ending. I think his talent is wasted here. I love all the characters in this movie and the dynamics of the relationships of the characters between each character .I love Lee Jong Suk movies you can’t just watch one and not get hooked on each character he portrays.He will be missed dearly but we will look forward to his return in two years .I am forward to the rest of the episodes and thanks to all who worked hard to make this drama series happen❤️❤️. One thing is for certain; Lee Jong Suk knows how to choose his projects, because he\\'s hit another home run in this drama. He\\'s simple wonderful to watch, making his craft look easy when it is not easy; making himself look comfortable when there are times he couldn\\'t be, and absolutely imparting his joy in what he does on screen! Thanks Jong Suk. Can anyone please tell me the name of the song that plays in both ep. 9 & 10 while Eun-Ho is taking care of the writer? Its either all or mostly in English, and it\\'s not listed as part of the OST yet, but I LOVE IT so far. If anyone knows, I\\'d really appreciate it. Can anyone tell me what the song in ep. 5 where Dan-i, Eun-Ho and Hae-Rin is driving back from talking with Mr. Park? just give it a try, it such a good drama, it really is.you can never ask for more, because it was lee jong suk. i was just really sad that this will be the last drama of Lee Jong Suk, i will definitely wait for his comeback. I love the story. I couldn\\'t wait for the new eposodes to be released. Love the character esp dan-i. Her feelings is not obvious if she\\'s actually falling for eun-ho. Or is she confused. So it adds excitement to the viewers as to when she fall in love w/ him. I know. Hae-rin is stealing this show. I really would love to see her as a lead someday. Hopefully with the same strong willed but cute character like on this one. So I\\'m rooting for Hae-Rin 100% in whatever she does. The others, I feel a little put off. @Helen Hayes @Lavandolyn Smith It\\'s 마음이 살짝 기운다 (My Heart is Drawn to You), by Na Tae Joo. It was published on 18 Feb 2019. You can order it from kyobobook.co.kr. Lee Jong Suk really likes that poet, he did a collaboration in 2017 with a pictorial of him and poems by the poet, called 모두가 네 탓 (It\\'s All Because of You/It\\'s All Your Fault). And LJS discovered him when he had to recite one of his poems in School 2013 (the Wildflower poem). Na Tae Joo\\'s poems have not really been published in English, but they are really nice! i was crying so much and laugh on crazy moment they have .. its such a beutiful story so touching.. and the story of an old book .. the script was so good i really feel it. What is the name of the book he is reading in episode 10 at 17:49 mark. I love this drama What is the name of the book that he is reading in episode 10 at the 17:49 mark? Have not watched a fantastic drama as this in a very long time. Lee jong suk as usual, hit it on the nail with his interpretation of eun ho. The fear of losing his best friend and saviour is real since a one-sided crush can destroy a relationship if the other does not reciprocate. Eun ho is not a coward. If he had revealed his feelings back when he was young, Dan I would have still chosen her ex husband for security reason. Eun ho also tested his feelings by dating other people and to ascertain the devotion of his true love. I find myself laughing at all the funny reactions of the characters. I also like Kang Dan-I when she has a thoughtful expression on her face and when she smiles. I really wish I didn\\'t binge-watch the whole season because now I have to wait for Saturday for the ninth episode The story is getting better now, and just thought that if Dan-i doesn\\'t exist it\\'s a lot better. Eun ho and Hae rin is more perfect. I could not find the last song at the end of ep 9..???. Watching eun ho cry breaks my heart. i want eun-ho and hae-rin ended up together:( Episode 9 killed me. Hae-Rin unnie!!:\\'( This is a romantic comedy drama, but why is this making me cry so much? The scenes are so awesome and touching. I am also enjoying the chemistry between the leads. It\\'s so cute, at the same time, romantic and funny. Overall, the drama is very amazing. You can\\'t hold back your tears watching worthy life-teaching moments. Me to lee jong suk: “the moon is beautiful.” Pleaaassseeeee, I want the rest of the episodes:\\'(:\\'( This is the first time I watched Lee Na Young’s drama and I can say that she’s pretty good. And of course Lee Jong Suk- he ceases to amaze me. I love the romance between these two. This show is my favorite show now to watch. I want to be a writer someday and I love to read books. I love the romance in this story. My favorite character is Cha Eun-Ho. I always get happy when he is dramatic and talks to himself when he is jealous of Kang Dan-I and Ji Seo-Joon. I find myself laughing at all the funny reactions of the characters. I also like Kang Dan-I when she has a thoughtful expression on her face and when she smiles. I really wish I didn\\'t binge-watch the whole season because now I have to wait for Saturday for the ninth episode. (sigh). I love the subtitles as I follow the story line. Even though I do not understand the Korean Language, it sounds like long string of music. Cha Eun-Ho is a man in love with a woman who does not know where her love interests stand. Great drama so far! But does anyone know the really upbeat song it plays every now and then? One scene that had it was when the main girl was told in episode 3 that her blurb wasnt good enough and then she started doing more research in the library straight after. The song is mainly in English from what I heard. I really like it but can\\'t find it! Would appreciate the help. the second leads have no chemistry together. from the scenes where they interact, you don\\'t get the same flutters when they\\'re focusing on the leads they like. that\\'s the only weakness to this story i\\'ve seen so far. What is the name of the song that plays in episode 8 when Ms. Sao explains why she got a divorce to Dani and Ms. Go?? Nice story & cute show.....but at times i feel like at that age (38) why is dan yi still so dumb at reading eun ho’s feelings...& then it dawned upon me that eun-ho too is dumb when it comes to expressing his feelings after going down, losing her & waiting for 7 years. Oh my....though this story is nice to watch to fill up the time & the actors are ok too....But the irony of it is that this story truly fits ‘dumb & dumber’ parody.. Lee Jong Suk\\'s drama never disappoints me. Such a cute show. Watching on Netflix and did not know it was live - have to wait for the next episode. have to say I do not like the character Ji Seo Jun - but I guess that is what makes the show worth watching. I have to disagree with the naiveté of Da Ni - I think she knows exactly what she is doing. No woman has a \"little brother\" who allows her the freedom Eun Ho has. Still the dynamics of the comedy will be worth watching. After all Love does conquer all so they say! Good job guys - keep it up Hwaa..love the story and ost... the song of Jannabi (A story i couldn\\'t see) is so damn good..i don\\'t know but that song makes my heart ache..the song is so sad.. It\\'s our bonding movie/film with my daughters 10 & 12. We watch it after dinner on Netflix. It\\'s a warm, funny and romantic movie rolled into one. Plus focusing on the friendship and professionalism at work is great. We love it and were a big fan. Dan-i and Mr. Cha delivers the character above and beyond. Make more Episodes please... Its a well rounded film covering major topics in life. I love this drama! I don’t really get the comments about Dan-I and Eun-Ho and how they don’t want them to get together when it’s clearly going that way and I’m fine with it. Guys can harbor romantic feelings that long it’s not that unrealistic even my mom got back with her Hs bf in real life years after they’d both dated and married other people and my brother actually did the same. It’s also clear by them being the leads that’s where it’s going. The age gap doesn’t bother me that’s also quite normal and for her and Eun-Ho it’s only 5 years. Regardless of that I love how it tangles other storylines and gives us some back info on Seo and Go and everyone else. It makes for a really interesting kdrama. This is the kind of drama that we all need. It touches love to family, to sibling, and most importantly, to self. It will also make you realize you\\'re lucky to have a normal job. The night out of Dan-i with Ms. Go and Ms. Seo was gold -3 women pouring their tears over their sad love stories. Even without the romance with Lee Jong Suk, I think would still want to watch this series. Ahh Dan Yi is starting to notice Eun Ho\\'s feelings for her. I just cant wait for them to be officially together and also after seeing episode 8 I\\'m now rooting Hae-Rim and Seo Joon too. I hope they\\'ll end up with each other. Ahhhhhhhh when is the next update? I wanna watch ep 7 already. I don’t want Dan-i and SeoJun to be together either. I really like this show so far, although, I really hope that the writers surprise me and not to do the usual long time friends turning into lovers I, on the contrary to previous commenter, like Da Ni quite a lot. Kang Dan Yi is annoying. There is something in her that I don\\'t like. To me, her naivety is meant to take advantage of men without even she realised. She doesn\\'t need to do any effort to create a helpless woman image to capture the men\\'s attention. I miss U Eun-ho Made my Night sleepless.watching when my kids is sleeping.all cast is very good in acting. Lee na-young is my favorite actress this series made me come back to reading. i love how the writer gave a character like kang dan yi. im so inspired by her. i hope dan yi gets recognized, and i hope she gets the love she deserves. she is a gem. I LOVE THIS DRAMA SOOOOO DAMN MUCH! Lee Jong Suk’s Acting was..... no words to say. And I love the way Park Gyu Young acts toooo. Ahhhhhhhh when is the next update? I wanna watch ep 7 already. I don’t want Dan-i and SeoJun to be together either. I really like this show so far, although, I really hope that the writers surprise me and not to do the usual long time friends turning into lovers. The past connections reminds me of the in need of romance series. I actually quite like Dan-Yi and Seo-Joon\\'s chemistry and would like for their story to develop. It will be very predictable if Dan-Yi and Eun-Ho end up together. Besides that I am enjoying the aesthetics, love the clothes and the set. Like most people are saying, I don\\'t mind the age gap. I watched Witches love, Can I hear your voice and I enjoyed the story. But this is a little different, their romance kind of seems like Dan-i is guilt tripping him into loving her, and I don\\'t feel like it\\'s right for them to have a relationship, perhaps with the way they act as older sister-younger brother would be fine, but it would be unnatural for them to date. And the past few episodes she\\'s been leeching off of him a lot, like I get life is hard as a single mother at age 37, but it\\'s best to be more independent than constantly relying on a younger friend. The secretly staying in his house part especially pissed me off.... Ommo Jong Suk and Eugene reunite after W. Hope they\\'re gonna work again in the future as the leads.:) Hope other PD-nim will give Eugene a chance to be a lead in a drama. Wow my my top 3 k dramas currently airing The plot is interesting for book worms who wish to be involved in the book making/publishing process. As for the main leads, I really want to see their relationship stay platonic and the author would really have a fan in me if s/he does that. I don’t have an issue with the age gap, I’ve watched Jong Suk’s other drama, Can you hear my voice and super loved it, he does well in these kinda tropes lol It’s just that I think it’s unhealthy for a person to garner romantic feelings for that long!!! I wish the author would develop his character into a more dynamic one where he realizes that it is time to live his life with a healthy heart, untied to some unrequited love. I think Kdrama should invest more in male leads who undergo a life-changing process. Romance is not the only answer. i really need to know the english song in episode 1 it is sooooooooo touching!!!! super love it huhuhuhu please let us know I love this drama so much.i don\\'t know the female lead but she is really doing a good job but as for jungsuk, he never disappoint.fighting!!!!! Oh what a charmer! So far every episode interesting, think it\\'s main actress, she is that good. I feel her every emotion.. Of course older woman younger guy my type of story, my mom 10 years older than my dad and they are married 53 years! C\\'mon people gaps fine! Didn\\'t know about main lead, I know of him and he is very popular bit Anyone know about the English song in this drama? BTW. Her name is Kang and his is Cha but his father is Kang. Does this mean they probably related? I don\\'t think the two leads should end up together, I have no problem with the age Gap but she sees him as her little brother and it should stay that way. The 2nd make lead is even younger (and I bet he turns out to be Eun Ho long lost actual brother) but I think he and Kang Dani make a better fit with Hae Rim getting her man Eun Ho. Just my opinion. Liking the drama and all the characters Looking for the english songs, anyone know?? Hope don\\'t be like that mysterious song on drama \"live\" :D surprisingly I love this drama.its better than the recently ended noona-dongsaeng drama.this drama is relatable i started watching this drama because i was curious and also because i like the whole \\'my job is a chief editor\\' thing and i tried to keep my expectations low - like, what if this turns out to be one of those cliched dramas about falling in love at work and getting in trouble for that? I am usually not a fan of a drama that is paring up a younger actor with an older actress, but I love this drama so much. The drama is calm, warm, and of course charming. It’s very lovely. I love the main actors’ relationship. Looking forward to it. I gave it 10+/10 ❤️❤️ Maybe ep 1 its the less appealing ep so far, but start from ep 2 its really exciting, now im in ep 6 and crave for the next ep. weekend come fast pleaseee Love love love ❤️ ❤️❤️.. i love the story, relatable, one of the best kdramas I’ve watched so far I love this new kdrama, its so natural and calming acting from leading actors. Listening Leena young spoke makes me understand her well, their acting it’s something really very touching. Eps 2 make me crying....Hope there will be romantic episode later ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ Thanks for airing this such a wonderful drama, lately (one year maybe) iam not watched kdrama due to boring storyline. Now im ON. Thanks tvN-always gives us amazing series. DY\\'s attitude is killing me. She is too indiscreet and curious about EH\\'s love life. i love hae rin with eun ho better:( I loved it. This is another type of drama and its looks natural also . This is the awesome part of korean dram sweet and simple . I had watched many drama like chinese ,indian, korean . But i luv korean drama cause its sweet and simle. Indian tooks minimum 5/6 years to complete and lots of overacting and melodrama .All drama has same plot but in korean drama its has different plot . writer is not crule to femle lead i had seen many single mother condition worst than her and i dont thik he is making her sympathy object . he is making her strong and independent .I love what LJS do .

Really enjoying the drama，love the storyline of struggles an average person faces which is real，as well as the music. It is light heated , filled with hope ,love . Chasing it! So I’m on episode 1 and reallly confused. How do Cha Eun Ho and Dani know each other? I’m just confused about the plot of how they got there in the 1st episode. Please help? I’m confused So far so good, I’m usually into really heavy plots but I’m actually enjoying this drama. Lee jungsuk is Bea but I’m having second lead syndrome? can’t wait for more episodes to come!! what song was playing in the coffee shop scene (the water splashing one) Already in love with this drama. To be honest anything with Jongsuk in turns out amazing, he really does have a face you can\\'t get sick of. I can\\'t believe this is his last drama before he enlists in the military, you will be missed Jongsuk and i will be waiting eagerly for your return to the acting scene. Wish you the best with your enlistment. Glad i\\'m not the only one whos crying hard at the end of ep 3:( idk why, but he is love her so much even if she already has a family... where is the comedyyy? :(( huaaaaa I love the drama! Not only Jong-suk is super cute in it but also it\\'s just so....real I guess? Can\\'t wait till the weekend again.. i like this drama so much, very touched. lee jong suk play the role deeply, i can see that he has love verry deep for that nuna. i cant wait for the next eps. Beautiful and touching drama. LJS is ethereal as usual...like he is too good for this world. LNY complements him wonderfully... One of the best dramas this year, eagerly waiting for every episode and really hoping for the best ending. Crying so much in the final part of episode 3. @arif se. because it’s a noona romance????? ofc she should look older. I truly love you Lee Jong suk I\\'m forever your fan.. all the dramas you had made my heart so in love???? 2nd lead syndrome? The weirdest thing that i really can\\'t understand it is how all jong suks dramas not in comedy genre but i laughed alot in all his dramas and this drame rated in comedy genre but it\\'s soooo.. Uncomedy drama.. Idk lets see what will happen in new eps I really love the first few episodes,the female lead is strong and independent and doesn\\'t rely on anyone and knows when to ask for help.I really really love how it included lgbtq representation with the clothing store owner and hair salon owner,even though it was really short its a really huge step as kdramas really rarely have lgbtq representation in a positive and normal light Loved it since episode 1 ❤ can\\'t really wait for the next more episodes. i love it its intresting......waitng fr upcoming episodes.... Its remind me of Takuya Kimura drama Long Vacation when I fist see the trailer. So hooked on the first episode absolutely loved the set up and characters Dan I and Eun ho I’m so digging my heels in and am gonna stay to the end! The scriptwriter has really given the characterisation of Dan I a lot of thought and how she was literally on the bones of her rear end. LJS is just fine looking and a very charismatic actor. I’m so looking forward to the next few months of RIABB.Thank you cast and crew❤️ Can\\'t wait anymore...... He used to have a crush on her and now he gets to be in a drama with her, i bet he\\'s over the moon with happiness now. A fresh drama genre for LJS. First time to watch LNY and looks promising. must watch it.. bcos I know leejongsuk is really good choosing for his drama.. all his drama is daebak... lee nayoung acting of course one if the reason i must watch this.. can\\'t wait for next week.. It feels like the female character lied about her age. Its hard to find work when you\\'re older and the fact that they emphasized Jong Suk\\'s character as the youngest chief editor could be a correlation to her lie. Just a theory. Wow aftee encounter , we meet again the handsome younger man with beautiful older woman, and both are wife of handsome actors too, joongki n wonbin, how lucky they\\'re??? I liked the writer\\'s In Need for Romance 2 and Discovery of Romance, so I am going to watch it. But I\\'m so tired of Lee Jong Suk and his boring portrayal of his characters. I loved radio romance wholeheartedly and if this is anywhere close to it I just know I\\'m going to love every minute of it. From the plot it sounds like radio romance. Yet we no Suk always delivers. So place it on your to do list. Do not worry ladies and gemtlemen we can boycott any writer forced by agency directors and producers who send us to watch sniveling weak, empty headed females bots. Can\\'t wait for watching this.. Lee Jongsuk and Lee Nayoung Fighting!! Looking forward it.. More like I’m gonna ship LNY and WHJ! I loved him with BDN in Matrimonial Chaos. @TamTam, Encounter has a mega rich CEO woman with a normal everyday man! and she\\'s awesome not a mean person (cos we all know that\\'s how powerful women get introduced in dramas) CANT WAIT i hope its great! ill miss ljs sooo much since this is his last project before enlisting so im wishing this will bring strong impacts and high ratings!! I just found out that lee nayoung make a comeback with this drama, and lee jongsuk is on this drama too... woow Somehow I think TVN channel is the only channel that has lots of promising drama of all time. All of the previous dramas was so good, and the upcoming dramas also look promising, with interesting storyline and excellent actors. Thank you TVN the poster does not really attract me Noona romance! Sign me up!! Lee Jongsuk and Jung Eugene together again hmm?? Why is it always the female who is broke or not rich lol This sounds a lot like Younger and the Korean versions of Liza and Charles. I\\'m all up for that. jongsuk and his ideal type nayoung? Meeting in a drama? I will watch this for sure! I hope Kong Seung Yeon for female lead please pd-nim @FEEE what Kim Ji Won ... Did you know KJW have new drama with Song Joong Ki ... Ouh Come On Dudeeee ... Hopefully the main actor is beautiful and the acting is really good His last work before military service. i hope with Kim Ji Won Please.. yes.. lee nayoung pls accept.. can\\'t wait for this new pairing.. Kim Go Eun, Kim Seul Gi, either one please! I think this will replace Memories of Alhambra. cannot waittt Han hyo joo or Yoona .... Please . Kim Seul Gi please Yay Lee sung kyung for the lead kim so eun for female lead please',\n",

       "  'comments': 'It\\'s crazy good! I can\\'t believe the ratings are so low. People should not sleep on this hilarious drama. The female leads are amazing. Lee Yuri hands down is crazy, funny, just great. I knew her from My Father Is Strange and have loved her since then This story is truly hilarious. It’s fun, funny & tickles you in every episodes. You will laugh till your funny tears run dry...hehe. I was laughing so hard the last time when i was watching laughter in waikiki...and this drama too seems to be going that way. Tq mbc for this. After a hard day’s work...this really made my day.. Why this drama rating too low? i\\'m honestly surprised this isn\\'t getting higher ratings? i personally find it hilarious, plus it\\'s fun to have a drama that focuses on a evolution of a female friendship this drama is so funny! Can i ship these 2 lead actresses? Interesting and well-planned plot, so far. I love this drama. Really interesting and funny I love this drama very much..... So funny... I\\'m waiting every week to watching this drama.... Yuri is cute.... I love watching yuri and leebom in comedy drama.... This drama is freaking funny! I\\'m currently on my 8th episode but I can\\'t wait to watch the next episode! Both of them played the characters (even switched) really really really well!!!! Lee Yuri is just shameless when she acts as Kim Bomi but totally naive when she acts as Lee Bom! I thought Uhm Jiwon is a sophistication woman (based on the first episode) but she can portray Kim Bomi character very very well too!! Shout out to this drama bcs it\\'s been long for me to watch a very funny and silly drama with great storyline too! Watched 4 episode and by far this is funny and intresting plot.. totally loved it❤❤ this drama are so funny.. already watch 2ep.. maybe they got low rating bcos of the body switching is already cliche genre for kdrama.. I already watched the 2 episode of this drama, and I love it so much! Too bad they got very low rating. Well, I love the 2 actress. They are my favorite:) This drama is too funny . Can i ship these girls? Choi Byung-Mo is back again after \"Miracle We Met\"? i think it has similar plot I just watched this drama look funny in first episode Lee Yuri is backkk!!! Hope its another great project body swap is not a new, i think the most unique one is Big , not usual body swap because one person is awake and changing while the other still sleep I don\\'t care if its same typical genre, Body switching is a common plot device, John. same concept as Room No 9 unni is back again!!!!!!',\n",

       "  'comments': 'enjoyed this drama so much sweet funny sad, both couple n always team blended very well. good job @just a namja - i pity you girl for the way of your thinking.. we maybe thrilled by this drama but it doesn\\'t know that we are blinded to the real world. don\\'t generalized all the men in the world if thus even your own father is also bad for he is a man too. i guess you don\\'t a have a partner now because of the way that you think. We got comedy, we got romance, we got cuteness, we got thrilling case, we got action. Complete package . It so entertaining!! awwwww end of Ep 12 is so heartbreaking..... I can\\'t wait for Ep 13. @just a namja I don\\'t think you should bring news that not even related with this drama. This just a drama to entertain people and I think you should write Jonghoon (Ft Island) instead of Highlight:) Girls seem to be captivated by this romance-comedy drama as if most boys/men are good, loving and caring like Kwon Jung-rok. In real life, most boys/men are bad, unloving and uncaring sex-maniacs like Seungri(BigBang), JJY(1N2D), Jonghun(Highlight) and Jonghyun(CNBlue). There are many genres of drama. Touch Your Heart has sweetness overload! Best drama ever, i love chemistry between lee dong wook and yoo in na...can\\'t wait for next episode I recently commented about the drama and now I have an update. The drama is definitely getting heated now, especially since ep 11. Can\\'t wait for the remaining episodes. The antagonist, Lee Kang Joon, is pretty terrifying and I hope the plot strengthens henceforth! Touch Your Heart, fighting! So far so good. Their chemistry is real? Yes! who else finds the antagonist CEO Lee Kang joon. He is Sooo Handsome!??? This drama is oozing with so much sweetness! I love this drama so much!! My first and last fav drama ever? really love to see my one and only fav male actor Lee Dong Wook acting in this drama with this beautiful actress ♥️ what a romantic pair ever .. HOPE TO SEE MORE UPCOMING ROMANTIC DRAMA WITH LEE DONG WOOK TO BE THE MALE LEAD ACTOR!!!!! Ommo!! Jay is so handsome! I absolutely love this drama, not only because of the star studded cast but also for their chemistry. Bad drama bad writer bad acting, this shown is bad even encourter was better ( i didn’t like this one too) yoo in ah doesn’t no know how to be funny she overact and lee dong wook as always has only one expression and his character doesn’t help he is too easy!! I\\'m getting diabetes. The characters and the story is sweet n fluffy. I almost never watched a full romance drama before except Coffees Prince and Another Miss Oh (if that considered as full romance ( ^^) ). But this one, I\\'m gonna watch this till it end. Recommended. No plot needed for fluffy story, at least I don\\'t need it u.u Usually I like serious drama, but dont know why, I cant wait to watch touch your heart episodes..lol. The story is lovely, and so their chemistry. Good job Lee dong wok and Yoo in na. And yes,both of you touch my heart. ❤ i love LDW and kind of enjoyed the drama for several episodes but there is no plot and i still cannot understand why the main female character acts like a 6 years old. anyway all the rest of the comments are positive so .... Love love love this drama.. yoo in na so cute??? This drama is amazing especially the main lead actor Lee Dong Wook and the lead actress Yoo In Na. They are the cutest in every way. They are so adorable and their acting is natural with chemistry that’s over the moon. This drama makes me fall in love, laugh, cry, thrilled. This is good for the heart, a really feel good one. I salute everyone who work hard to have this treasured show. This drama is sooo fluffy I love it. Don\\'t really get the roles of the second leads tho cos I enjoy the love line of Lawyer Choi x Dan more than the second leads ahahahaha i super love this one . I cant help but laugh and smile at them . love love love!?❤️ This kdrama is two thumbs up! Its worth watching!?? I really love the couple. Light story that will make you smile, laugh, feel loved. Good to watch. It\\'s like making you forgot the you have problems in real world. Haha Waiting for them to work together after Goblin. And Yeahhhhhh....finally Lee Dong Wook and Yoo In Na are main casts in Touch Your Heart. Yoo In Na is soooooooooooo sweet and cute in this drama. So does Lee Dong Wook, he portrays well in his character as Kwan Jung Rok. Both of them are so sweet and cute in their office romance. i love Lee Dongwook and Yoo Inha so much since Goblin, but this drama is boring. I \\'m sorry. Omg the drama really awesome ^^ I saw Madtown\\'s Jota and was freaking excited. He was one of the new employee in ep 8:) The drama is fantastic by the way. Someone should update the cast list- his real name is [Lee Jong Hwa] i am weirdly more excited about ms. Dan’s love life This drama is so good. This drama good, make my mood happy. Every week i waiting for episod??? I love this drama, the story is light and makes me smile always when watching it. and I love this couple, Lee Dong Wook and Yoo In Na ... I don\\'t care about ratings, because people\\'s tastes are different, some like light plays but some like serious dramas. even though the drama ratings is up and down, the couple is very loved and has many supporters. This is a good drama but I\\'m pretty sure that it won\\'t surpass the 10‰ viewership ratings, judging by the current plot. If the plot were to change later on then we\\'d never know. This drama is a lighthearted rom-com without a strong plot line as of now and since it\\'s the same director as Whats Wrong With Secretary Kim, I can see that Touch Your Heart is kind of like WWWSK. Both Yoo In Na & Dong Wook are such great & versatile actors and yes, they do justice to their roles in this drama but don\\'t get me wrong, I hoped for a lot more than this when it was announced that the Goblin Grim reaper & Sunny would be staring in a new drama together. I will be looking forward to what it\\'s going to deliver in the remaining eps since the son of Chaebol family is making his appearance now as a person whos watching rom com dramas/movies in japanese, chinese, thailand, taiwanese and korean movies,, GAD! even though other people perceived Yoo In Nas acting cute acting is sometimes cringey... well for me.. it was well delivered because she perfectly delivered what role shuold her character be!:P hahahahh anways i am hoping for LDW and YIN to get married in real life.. for real... XDDD I loved the chemistry of Lee Dong Wook and Yoon In Na. Daebak!!!! I love their chemistry..It\\'s actually light comedy romance:) Great to watch after a long tiring day:) Even for dramas from cable TV, that rating is still low for most people as viewers may compare this series with Goblin. Honestly, I don\\'t like Yoo In-Na acting this time, although I really like her as Sunny. This drama is awesome.. love romantic relations between Lee Song Wook and Yoo In Naa..their chemistry so lovely and hope they will have more project drama, film together in future.. I like this couple.. Pichi Couple or Heart Couple, whatever it is.. I fell in love with this couple (Lee Dong Wook and Yoo In Na)...and for those who say why this drama has a low rating, you are wrong, for dramas from cable TV, that rating is included as good. sooo in LOVE with this drama; the lead caracters are aweeeeesome i cant help loving them also the cast the storyline emotions acting skills comedy scenes all is greaaaaat; why rating is low i wonder Soooo inlove with this drama!! 16 episodes are not enough??? not that i dislike it ... but why is there so often the feeling of deja vu with goblin? This drama is so fun!! Let’s keep in mind that in the drama the two have never dated anyone! So this is all new to them:) I love how the female character is straight foward. It keeps things moving fast instead of them having inner diaglogue all the time (“does he like me?? Does she like me??) They are just so excited to be dating and in love with each other. this drama doesnt need to be heavy in all aspect, its good to be like a light feather as it is. just feeling the old feelings of starting to fall in love, being in love and staying in love...a feeling that doesnt need an explanation...just happy and in love???? yes that was Jota as one of the interns??? I don\\'t care about those cringy things thats the haters said because i still love them and excited for the next episodes about her stalker. The best part is not starting yet theres alot of people whos complaining like who cares if you dont watch.? It started out nice... but its too cringy at times.. why r they behaving like teenagers. I hope the storyline develops as of now its only trying to get viewers using their chemistry from goblin. Its a waste of talent of such good actors i really like this one. The main characters are sweet but I wished the female lead would act like a normal woman and not like a 6 years old. Whose Lee Gang Jun stalker Oh Yoon Seo? I want to know their past.. Exciting for next week ep.. What are the names of the interns? They are really funny? I like it when there are many references to Goblin. KJR and OJS hair style and character, ‘handcuff’, ‘first day as couple’. It feels great after crying in Goblin for sunny and wang yeo ending I\\'ve to admit that this drama is good. pretty good actually. the first and second eps didn\\'t really get my intention to watch it, but after the third eps i fall in love with this drama until now. twice a week isn\\'t enough of them!:( was it just me and my eyes or that the junghwa intern is actually jota?? I’m wondering it it was Jota on ep. 8???? I’ve been waiting for him to come back in entertainment industry. I think this kdrama was already planned for them even when Goblin was still being aired. I remember the last episode when Kim Sun and the Grim reaper reincarnated, the idea was somehow similar to this. Yoo In-na became an actress and Lee Dong-wook became a detective(which still has something to do with law enforcement right?!?) is that Jota madtown?in ep 8 it\\'s like 16 episodes won\\'t be enough. their love story need to be extend in real life... I love the drama so much! i like this drama, i love both actor and actress they are super cute,please extend your episode. i like this drama, i love both actor and actress they are super cute,please extend your episode. I wonder is it the drama that they filming in the goblin last ep?? do you remember the grim ripper and her love reincarnated together and being actress wkwkwk please extend your episode i love this drama.. I like this drama and why the rating so low. Can’t believe it Actually, for those wondering, these ratings are already quite good for a cable drama. Love this drama so much but I don\\'t understand why the rating is so low i actually like this drama, i do love strong female leads but this character is strong but is also super cute, has her moments of childishness and the the male lead is also not too standoffish, he has his moments, he is not cold to everybody, wants to keep a good relationship with his friends and i find that good. this is such a light feel good drama with tints of cases and legality and i like the premise and as usual yoo in na\\'s potrayal is also really good. ldw is love so lets not go there. sometimes you just need this cute, cloudy kinda love:) I love this drama... i dont understand why the rating is to low. Yoo In Na is soo cute in this drama. I laughed out loud at her comment \"Men, somebody please help them\" in episode 5. Her acting is phenomenal. She steals the show. I am so curious about Yoo In Na\\'s character\\'s backstory. She is clearly smart, hardworking, has a great memory, interested in law, but she dropped out of law school to become an actor. What happened? She seems like a warm, lovable, positive character who continues to try her best despite unfortunate circumstances, which also make her a vulnerable character. Makes me want to protect her. As for Lee Dong Wook\\'s character, it\\'s perfect. He accepts her flirtation and flirts right back. He\\'s not a cold person. He uses law to provide justice to the oppressed. He is just serious, professional and a workaholic. This kind of character is so much more cool than the typical tsundere male lead. So far this is one among the most touching drama that I\\'ve watch this year. I hope that after this drama they\\'ll have another project together, because you can\\'t definitely deny the chemistry between Lee Dong Wook and Yoo In Na. Fighting! Oh my. 16 episodes are not enough!!! My new fave kdrama! I love their chemistry and their acting. I also love the story. So romantic and comedy!!! I will give them perfect 100! @Frida it\\'s Always by Yoon Mirae. OST from Descendants of the Sun I think music is \"meke it count - chen\" Pls who knows the name of the Korean song played in ep 1 Pls who knows the name of the song played in ep 1 when she was imagining the character in the script of love hurts It is hilarious, cute, and touching. You will love this if you watch Secretary Kim. I find the storyline is more interesting. Back in Goblin, i am shipping for In-na and Dong-wook already. They have good chemistry and superb portrayal of their characters. In the last episode of Goblin where Wang Yeo ang Kim Sun was reincarnated, they were partnered in a situation that Dongwook was an investigator ang In-na was an actress going along with the investigator to study her role in her next movie. Its somehow similay to the synopsis of this Kdrama. It seems to me that the Gods in the Goblin took pity on the grim reaper so they gave them the chance to live and have a normal human romance!!! This one is truly refreshing!!!! pls who knows the name of the name of the song played in episode 1 when she was imagining the character I totally agree with you Safira. Even though there were no kissing scenes, the drama makes me giddy. This drama is so cute and funny. Looking forward for the next episodes. wow seriously you cant go wrong with tvn\\'s romcom! this drama makes me hooked from the first episode. a little bit slow but thats what we called Slow Burn Romance. love the main leads! their acting is superb! can\\'t wait to see the next episodes especially for the kiss scene. all the actors portrayed their characters very well. this drama deserves higher rating. I love this drama so much. Really sweet and fresh. I also want to thank to the writer, PD-nim, and also all the staff for the hard work.??? I love so much this drama.. They just so funny and really cute together I dont know why people say it is boring. For me I found this drama cute and romantic, even though story line is cliche. I love chemical between Dong wook and Inna. They are soooooo cute. I love this drama so much so far. The acting is so well done and I find my self going through so many emotions while watching. I know some people think it is cliche but I enjoy the romance and believe it will have a bit of suspense like Age of Youth and Suspicious partner. I cant wait to see this weeks episodes! as expected ..this drama have a great cast but the storyline looks so boring.. some scene remind me with other kdrama.. so cliche.. I\\'m watching this only for Lee Dong wook.. yoo in na acting sometimes over & cringy.. I\\'m surprised that the rating of this drama is so low. Like wht the heck? I Am Living For This Duo like Yoo In Na is giving me a relatable person that is very likable and cutely innocent yet obstinate and sweet. Lee Dong Wook is a mature man. But his hart isn\\'t frozen and that\\'s what I love. I feel the chemistry and the tense when they are alone. It\\'s almost a pure fanservice but I know we have seen only 4 episodes and I\\'m sure that some bad things are going to happen, but (and it\\'s a huge one) this drama is making me laugh and after a stressful day at work, school y\\'all can relax Love this film so much! How cute they are:3 Omggggg i really love this drama.. Idkw some people say its boring while for me its so funny and exciting to see the story that build up so good this far. I always thought why this end so much after one episode while it\\'s already past one hour huhu. why is the rating so low?/???????/ Don\\'t listen to the ones calling this one just pure \"fluff\".¨ OMG!! I knew it, from the first time I saw the teaser and the trailer I really hooked up with the story and of course I\\'m a big fan and one of the shippers of Dong-Wook and In-Na!.. from episode 1 up to the latest episode I keep on screaming in every Dong-Wook and In-Na scenes!! can\\'t wait for the next episodes ^__^ fighting!!! 4 eps in and yep I\\'m hooked. I wouldn\\'t use the word \\'fluffy\\' as some people have been using to describe this drama. It\\'s more than just that. It encompasses more than the typical mushy cute kdrama storyline. The drama tells a story of two people from seemingly different worlds yet their chemistry together is more powerful than anything. And absolutely amusing yet adorable to watch. This drama is beyond cute! The leads have amazing chemistry and I’m pretty sure that I spend every episode smiling. I’m not sure why the ratings are so low in Korea, but my American butt loves it!:) Yoo In Na saranghae I had expected the ratings to go down. Don\\'t know why so many viewers outside Korea likes this but it\\'s not getting good reviews from SK and I can see why. The script is so childish and boring and supporting actors suxk. Even Encounter was not so bad. Can\\'t believe my fave Yoo In Na and Lee Dong Wook pick this project. This drama ruined what\\'s probably their only chance to act together again. Urgh! I really love this drama.. So cute so fluffy kyaa.... But i just don\\'t understand why the rating is so not good.. I don\\'t think this drama is so bad.. I rather watch this drama more than encouter... Did you guys know who’s the students girl real name in the 3 episode? this drama is soo good, iam dying waiting for next week T.T I love Yoo In Na. She\\'s so pretty and funny. Her role in this drama suits her. Love her acting <3 This drama is lovely, cute and adorable! Okay, people complained how this drama is so boring, but it\\'s charm is not a complex plot, but a heartwarming plot. The characters it self are non-mainstream for most of rom-com. Kwon Jung Rok is not your everyday arrogant lead character, he is just cold and awkward, but he has a cute side of being clueless with woman and actually really considerate. And Oh Yoon Seo is not your everyday narcissistic actress, she is really warm, cute and innocent. They really fit each other! They have innocent growing love blossoming among them, not hate-love passionate relationship. It is steady and warming. this drama is so great! fluffy like the cloud, sweet as candy and fresh like the mountain air... I love this drama so much. after watching sky castle this drama is healing me.... so lovey dovey. go watch this drama guys, no regret. Loooove it to the bones... Loveee it... Im rating it to 110% love love loooove One of my favorite drama so far for 2019. I started watching it and i wait for the next few episodes to come Fyi the English song at the first episode was from micheal bubble haven\\'t met you yet Yoo In Na and Lee Dong Wook so cute??? i hope they\\'re in real relationship??? I relly love this drama xixi, yoo in na is so beautiful and cute T.T, the ost that chen sang is the best???? Immature acting by Yoo in na is what makes this drama cute. I love it Yoo In Na is a great actress. Enjoyed her acting since Goblin. Yoo In Na is so funny and the drama is so good, higly recomended. Really good drama...thumbs up!!! This is so funny, i\\'d like to recomended you everyone I\\'m so inlove with this couple from Goblin and now they have their own drama. I rewatch two episode for like 5 times, now really cant wait for third episode and upcoming episodes. Nomatter what the plots going at this drama, i will so inlove with them!!? Lee sang woo.....???????????? It\\'s just Ep2 but I feel like the rising action has already started. Both of them are absolutely good-looking and they make a fit combination. I bet everyone fell in love with them from Goblin❤ Rooting for upcoming episodes. The first episode is not really good, to be honest, the story is rather flat and both of main characters are not appealing, at first This drama is already soooo good! I love how their character somewhat resemble the roles they played in goblin! I’m already anticipating episode 3 - can’t wait for more!!! Am soooo loving this drama after I peeked in on the first episode and YIN is absolutely nailing her character as a ditzy pretty air head but decides to better herself after learning that her prettiness isn’t going to get her anywhere as a secretary. So we have 14 episodes left and I guess we’ll find out more about her journey along the way but it’s fun and LDW with the supporting cast are definitely going to make it an enjoyable one. Good vibe and storyline are in sync and what a great way to start! Cheers this is going to be an easy watch ❤️ this is drama very funny, yeah i like xoxoxo This drama is made up of 70% bickering, 20% PPL and 10% of Yoo In Na in slow-mo filtered zooms. 2 person in my very huge family likes it - one preteen and one who\\'s in-charge of cooking so she pops in once in a while when we watched the episode and was happy because she didn\\'t miss a thing. LOL this is much better than that new lee jong suk drama, that drama is suppeeerr boring. Light, enjoyable and sweet. I\\'ve been really looking forward to this romance drama! I really love Kim Dong Wook + Yoo In Na OTP! Looking forward to learning more of the characters\\' backstories. Its cute. typical ROMCOM, easy, sweet and funny. Nothing special. Quite enjoyable. I spent my time oggling at how beautiful yoo in na is when watching this drama. After watching sky castle and last empress which drove me crazy to the edge, watching a light drama like this is quite healing.... even though i kinda smell something behind yeon soo drug case and gullible character I was really looking forward to this because as with many fans of the 2nd couple of Goblin, I wanted a Rom-com from this two leads. But, it was a terrible letdown. omlllll,i just kept laughing and laughing like a fool. Seriously tho,the 1st ep was hilarious!!! I hope the rest of episodes are going to be funnier. Such a refreshing drama after finishing sky castle lol. Also,all the actors are sooo good! Love \\'em already \"Touch Your Heart\" is an enjoyable drama. Yoo In-Na\\'s acting is very cute, I can\\'t deny. But I wish women in this drama weren\\'t always portrayed dumber than men, and I\\'m not even a feminist or anything. I know that the basis of the plot is that Yoo In-Na\\'s character has never worked in a law firm, but still, I was expecting her to have street smarts and other hidden talents waiting to be discovered. Maybe they will be shown later on? For now, I\\'ve seen none. Just finished watching the 1st ep. and i’m loving this drama already! It’s refreshing and funny. Also, Kim Hee-jung is so pretty! I hope she’ll get to star in more dramas after this! This Drama is going to be hit!!!!!! Please take kimshin and euntak as a cameo pleeaasseee... it will make this drama perfect as 4th life of kim wo bin and sunny it’s funny after i realized that the ending from goblin was kim sun being an actress after her reincarnation. and wang yeo beside her as a detective. its relate so muchhhh from goblin? hope ji eun tak&kim shin will come as a cameo? This is what I\\'m waiting..!!! it\\'s like I will watch the Goblin sequel ^__^ I do not believe! Yoo In-Na and Lee Dong-Wook are together again in one drama!!! Yoo In-Na and Lee Dong-Wook were together again in one drama after the drama series Goblin. It looks like this will be one of the dramas that must be watched this year... OMGGGG lee dong wook and lee sang woo in one drama!! <3 I hope the story will be fun just like goblin drama. They are the reason i can finish watching goblin:D february 6 still next week LDW hair style is annoying ... lol Still wait Anyways Lee Sang Woo is more suited for long format family dramas I liked all his series as his character personality stays the same in all of them kind and caring type. Dude, everyone should have been jumping at the chance to cast these two as main leads after Goblin. They had such great chemistry it\\'s almost shocking that only now they end up together again. Gong Yoo and Kim Go Eun as a couple cameo pleasee This sounds like it will be cliche romcom but the leads are charming and endearing. Many OTP reunions didn\\'t as successful as the first one,fingers crossed to this drama to become a good one. Well for romcom, even with a bad storyline, they can make up with many hot kisses to secure the fans\\' interest so that\\'s it. Waaaaaaa.... I can\\'t wait this...  I don’t think is another tale attached to Goblin series. Will watch this. I was smiling over and over while watching teaser 5.... Can\\'t they just fall in love and get married in real life? they look so cute together! This is like a spin-off from Goblin. The story of reincarnated version of Sunny and the Grim Reaper. OMG! Im loving this already. Finally, I can watch a happy ending for these two. I\\'m crying. ㅠㅠ Can\\'t wait!!! gong yoo cameo please TT_TT The director did this on purpose didn\\'t he, the colour of Yoo In Na\\'s mustard coat, Lee Dong Wook\\'s tailored wool coat... and the bridge. The teaser is giving me goblin vibes lol >_< I cannot wait!!! PLEASE. TT____TT This must be a cute as hell drama??? cannot wait to watch it and i hope starting from this drama Yoo In-Ha won\\'t choose anymore supporting role offers! SOOOOO freaking excited for this!!! AYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY, don\\'t you just love when they listen to viewers. Giving us what we deserve, I can\\'t waittt!!! i recently watch a goblin again and in the last episode sunny become actor and grim reaper become police, some how its kind of same with the profession of the plot in this drama Sunny and Grim Reaper part 2!!! Can\\'t wait! AYYO , it going to come out next year .. woah woah cries ...but finally Lee Dong-Wook is the MC yayyy OMG! So this is for sure. Becouse there is the other cast and Lee Dong Wook and Yoo In Na are still here. Holy crap I might die of joy and excitement!!!! I loved their chemistry in Goblin! This is so exciting!!!!

       "  'comments': 'I did not watch the Japanese version but I think the viewers cannot compare the two version because the Korean version seems like more comedy style drama Still can\\'t get over Yui Aragaki\\'s heroine character in the drama. My problem when it comes to remake drama I guess lmao It\\'s a light-themed drama that somehow keeps you entertained without boring scenes. While it\\'s true that the acting isn\\'t that spectacular but personally I think they want to portray light comedic image here instead of some serious stuffs. And just saying it\\'s a cable drama so single-digit rating is normal. This drama is so good....and all actors are great..love it!!!!!! Seo Eun-so needs acting lessons or a better director. She bites her lip to convey uncertainty, and besides smiling, can’t do much else. She does do a convincing drunk scene, though. The writing is uneven and the storylines are all over the place. This is a below average drama and the ratings bear that out. Wowwwwww.. really loved this drama.. super. Must watch especially in the end of each episodes ha ha ha.... Is the rating low? I dont know much about ratings but loving this show..cant wait for the twist Love this show Yoon Park\\'s character is really annoying. Its has no different with the character in radio romance, I\\'m so tired of his dialogue, sucks. Loving it... cant wait for the episodes..hope rating increases oh i love this drama, it‘s sad that these beauties are underrated, but i enjoy every episode? can‘t wait for the next episodes, specially when go tae rim is falling for seo jae in??? Very funny, excellent cast, especially Seo Eun-Su, she acted so well. I like it , it s so funny:D Loving this drama... like that it is light hearted comedy even though dealing with complex emotions like friendship,loyalty, betrayal...cant wait for the next ep Jin Goo is soo good in his role. really make me laugh hard When i saw the japanese version the MC remain me of cha tae hyun. What i love about legal high is how depth the characterizations are for every person involved in the drama. They are well-connected to each other and their actions even though difficult to understand and the beginning, you will be able to put the pieces together one by one for how good the flow of their story is. I might\\'ve expected more scenes during the actual trial court because this is a drama about laws and the people working for the law but their lives on their offices and how they deal with their own personal conflicts together with their responsibility as lawyers makes it enjoyable for me especially by the antics and funny moments they have even though it does makes it ridiculuous for laywers to act silly or maybe i am just stereotyping lawyers to be uptight and stiff, hahaha. at first I was annoyed --but after watching the 2nd episode the drama is getting more interesting -- good actors in their character roles Meh.. Draggy I can see only Hatori here Not mean to compare with original version, but this remake sooo... disappointed. The main character and concept of this serial completely different from \"Legal High\" series. One of the reason is...why the main lead has so little screentime? I barely see his scene along the drama than side lead. nam goong min would be perfect for this role. This is a good and funny drama, but i still hope they will not include romance, just focus on what make the jdrama good..and for anyone going to see this, just dont make comparison to the drama that they remake from, and you will be good to go and enjoy..I am not saying that comparison and opinion are not important, but sometimes just enjoy it as a separate identity and you will be stress free:) just my opinion I love Jin goo but so far this show is unwatchable.. Quite an enjoyable and comedic drama.(now at Ep 3) One of my fave Kdramas is Ad Genius Lee Tae Baek... It had some comedy and it made me cry a lot as well so I\\'m not really that adamant with Jin Goo playing this role... JTBC makes really funny dramas and I haven\\'t seen the Japanese version of Legal High so I have nothing to compare to at this point... I\\'m at episode 2 and so far I\\'m loving it and how Jin Goo acts here... tho I may have some bias coz I love Jin Goo... Heheheh I\\'m not gonna say anything yet. Liar Game korean ver. was really good. I hope i can enjoy this one a lot too. After watch the teaser, honestly I kinda judging about this. i will not judge but i just hope they don\\'t add a love line. komikado sensei and mayuzumi never had anything going on (like AT ALL, even if my kdrama watcher heart wanted something lol). it would ruin it I think we should wait the outcome first of the drama before judging it base on Actor/Actress, its too early to judge the cast and i think if they are professional artist they can adjust thier self into the character. I completely agree with Yoona. Legal High is hands down my favorite Japanese series of all time and I cannot, at all, picture Jin Goo playing that character. Hate to be a downer on this but I call a miscast here. this is hard, i don\\'t see jingoo pulling off komikado sensei unnni fighting first lead woah , I heard today two news Shin Hye Sun and Seo Eun Soo My golden life , stars.. good luck ^^ deserve both^^',\n",

       "  'comments': 'Just done with Episode 5. I am taking much longer to finish the drama since I have to pause in betweens. It so intense! I need to process how heavy the story and the characters are. Applause to the writer, director, actors and all the staff! I will be mad if there is not part 2 or season 2 (whatever u wanna call it) I like it and the storyline is amazing, I feel like last episode was rushed and too many things showed in 1 h (and less) and I think that was meant (Dramatic Cinema project) and I love it cuz u are watching a long film (I love creative/new things) but to be perfect and with the way it ened it shows that there will be season 2/part 2 but I watched too many dramas that had part 2 open end of the first season and that season 2 never cam so I hope it\\'s not the case here:( I have one question... I personally do not think ep 7 is rushed. There could be many twist and turns to end the story better. Be it positively or negatively. I can even accept it if they turned table and Kang is actually the double agent to reveal the hunting team through gross sacrifises of the kid and wife! So many possibilities and yet? They\\'ve put up a story like this? What\\'s with the recent endings with the so awesome storylines? First the Memories of Alhambra then come this? Dissappointed! >~< wow, for the first to sixth episode really made my blood rush, but the ending are confusing. how can the line story related to virus/illness which had\\'t even mentioned before? bcs i thought the end of this drama will explain about the villain\\'s dark pshycology or the hunter behind story but it was beyond , i mean really out of my expectation... Wait, suddenly ended? what\\'s up with the ending, it feels so rush, and the thing with the virus at the end of episode 7 is kind of unexpected but it doesn\\'t tie together with the story line though, The story line is more like an action psychological type of drama. This kind of ending make viewers think there might be another season, but there is not much room for development though. Over all the story line and the acting are good but the ending is just so so, too rushing. oh no!!!!! Why the story at episode 3rd so annoyed??????? Wowww!!! So satisfying it\\'s plot twist, Excellent!!! Lee Seo-Jin ..You’re awesome! You really understand who you are as a person and you have your own unique ways to display your confidence….that’s why you always do well in this business… Only 1 ep left.. So many spoilers@tim!!! episode 5 and 6 caught me by surprise at the same time very frustrated. Both Ko and Yoon made the biggest mistake that they confronted Kang by themselves. Kang is too smart to leave any evidence at all, and as detective they should know better that they won\\'t get anything from him, they need to work behind the scene instead of showing him their cards just like that, if they missed the actual truth by 1mm, he probably made a 1mm mistake somewhere in his scheme, they just need to find it without provoking him. who would think that the prey is actually the hunter, and the trap is his to begin with, his character is well written. Can\\'t wait for the last episode, I wonder how the writer will wrap this up in just 1 episode left, maybe they should make it 8 episode instead of 7. Well im glagd im not alone. Its too short. Theres 7eps only. It so awesome. so sad that it only has 7 episodes, whyy T___T First time commenting Korean drama. I find this one very exciting. Can\\'t wait the next episode.??? Wow wow wow!!!!!!!! Awesome drama.... I\\'m so sad it is only 7ep. It is a very great drama. Lee Seo Jin!!! Yes! Seo Jin is back with another great drama! Not like the predictable ones.. And I fully agree with Tim that OCN dramas are either a hit or a miss..and this one is good! Hope it\\'s going to be good all the way since this is only 7 eps and not have to be dragged on and on when they have ran out of storylines! this is so lit!! i love all of actor and actrees. and so sad that kang shi woo was dead. wow, this drama is a total hit, good solid story line, good acting. OCN dramas are either a hit or miss, this one definitely a hit. This is a new program from OCN called \"OCN dramatic cinema\" so they use the \"film and drama\" format for this drama, so if you pay closed attention you can see that it looks like theatrical movie more than tv drama, the way they processed the images is different, the angle and color look different too, and I think it cost more than the traditional way of shooting tv drama, plus they have another series after this one. I think the same method was use on \"kingdom\" a Netflix series. Woo-hoo Seo Jin is back!!! Thanks a lot... Yay! I luv this guy... more 3 Meals a Day or Youn\\'s Kitchen... LSJ fighting! with these good actors and good story line why only 7 episodes I\\'ve been watching him in grandpas over flowers, never watch any movies or dramas he\\'s in, so will wait for this one. I’m so excited for Seo Jin oppa’s comeback. It’s a pity that there’re only 7 episodes. T_T I wish it has more episodes though..why only 7?.I need to see my Mr.Grumpy in the screen longer??Im so excited for this one. song ji hyo famale actor please Okay OCN, you kill me. OCN dramas are the best... I can’t wait to watch it?',\n",

Outstanding performance by all the actors! Jung II-Woo and Go Ara need to win Awards! Have to say, this is one of the best historical drama this year. Can\\'t wait for next week\\'s episodes. i am so obsessssssss with this drama,intense and thrilling at the same time,Go ara as Yeoji well there is nothing to complain,people give her a chance,there is no awkward moment from her in this drama,she keeps improving,and the one reson i love her character in this drama is she is not a dumb shell in distress,she is such a badass,with all the fighting scene omg i just fall in love with her character,and she is also super pretty,and the romance and her chemistry with Ilwoo is on point,but what is wrong with the ratings, i am so mad this kind of drama deserves more recognition and higher rating, i will give 9.8 out of 10,kudos to all the actors and actress,they are doing a great job Go Ara is super pretty in this drama N her acting is getting better too, so let’s give her a chance n support her♥️♥️♥️ This drama is honestly amazing, I love the cast and the story is very interesting, I\\'m never getting bored with it. I can\\'t wait to see tomorrow episode, how are Yeoji and prince Yeoning gonna sort this mess out? Kwon Yool never lets down his fans... Great drama with excellent cast! Jung Il woo and Kwon Yul are especially exceptional in their roles, the best they have played! Can\\'t wait for more episodes to come! Finally a drama that brought me out of my slump. Haechi is a good drama. Worth to watch especially when Jung Il Woo is the actor. He is the best for this kind of historical drama. It\\'s fun to watch him again... I tried to watch him acting in a modern drama but it\\'s kinda awkward.? Well no further comment... Good story line good actors and actresses. The bad prince is really bad guy.. I can\\'t remember his name. Well done to all. good drama not violent and with fun side of it--- good actors in their character roles For those who get frustrated w/ ratings, y\\'all should aware that there has 2 saguek drama airing right now, perhaps there\\'ll be an improvement. CrownedClown drama ended? I really don\\'t get the ratings...This drama is extraordinary good. The plot is good, not boring at all. Jung Il Woo in this role is so good, it\\'s insane, he really did not come to play. I just can\\'t wait to see the next episodes and I keep thinking what they will do...? Intense and exciting! I\\'m waiting for new episodes weekly! I love this drama. Prince Yeoning is my favorite character & YeoJi. The cast & the story writing is good. I look forward to all the new episodes. I wish the ratings were higher and more fans would tune in. The power struggle is real in this drama. Will the Good or the Bad stay in power? Will Prince Yeoning take his rightful seat on the Throne? How many episodes will it take? I will watch until the end.❤️ Watching the first 2 episodes...so far is great. Jung ill woo & kwon yul are seasoned actors. Kwon yul had most of the times in previous drama played the bad guy- and he always played the role too well! Go Ara is so far so good- i have seen her in miss hamurabi...and she did a great job there...she was really good as compared to when i watched her in hwarang. So fighting go ara...you can do this.. Jung Il Woo is extra good at acting in this drama an epic historical drama..Haechi reminds me with Hwarang because of the bromance jidwi and seowoo and same goes to prince yeoning and monsoo..love the triplet brotherly the eldest prince yeoning second brother monsoo and the young sister yeoji..monsoo always makes funny love this drama but im so sad because the prince reon ryeong died..i just cant wait for the next episodes  After watching jang ok jung , I can\\'t watch this I have really been enjoying this drama. The entire cast is great. Interesting kdrama. Thank you to all of the actors, director & all crews i watched it because of jung il woo i miss him so much but it\\'s really good and i can\\'t wait for next episode.. i think it will be one of i have enjoy watching this drama. It\\'s one of my favarite drama . Dong Yi\\'s son, Yi San\\' grandfather... i normally only binge watch.. but i don\\'t think i can wait on this one. saeguk is my favorite this is my type of drama! A new drama set in a fascinating world of Korea\\'s past! Another epic episode in the tales of the Joseun dynasty! Very promising. Story and cast are all good so far in the first 4 epi. I only hope this continues and maybe even better in the next episodes. If it does, then, they better have it run longer. So good to see jung il woo again in historical drama. My all time fave actor of his age bracket. He\\'s good in fighting.. physical and sword fight that is, like in moon river, a diary of night watchman and moon embracing the sun. Great in action. I have yet to see him tho in current time action drama. Like police or crime story. This drama ia recommended! Love how the story flows . And i love how the acts together. Here i can see the different side of Kwon tool. Hopefully it Will be great until the drama Ends. Please director-nim, hope the actionnya scenes becomes better than ep 1. Fighting!!! I just saw the first 4 episodes and this drama is so good. I am not a big fan of historical dramas but this seems to be very promising. The plot is interesting. Same writer as dong yi!! Its related!!! j\\'adooore en attendant la suite! Lee Geum is the son of Choi Suk-Bin and King Suk-Jong from \"Dong Yi\" drama. I saw the first two episodes and i\\'m so excited, excellent job jung ll-woo and Go Ara are so good i think this will be my favorite drama. Your the best oppa??? So glad to see Jung Il-Woo in this drama! It’s finally time for Go Ara to shine ♥️♥️♥️ Very excited to see this; I love action. Only here for Jung Il Woo!! Welcome Back Oppa Yes Go Ara!!! Story looks promising and the cast too. I’m keen to watch this drama because of the pairing of Jung Ill Woo + GA they’re both talented and have a lot of acting experience between them. I did not necessarily want to watch it, not a fan of historical drama but the teaser is top, second drama with vagabond that makes me want to watch it only with a teaser Ugh! GO Ara? I want to look forward to see this drama but Go Ara?huhuhu daebak, ilwoo and kwon yooll.. ,???????? Can\\'t wait Go Ara for her upcoming Kdrama... ^_^ Yaasssss im so happy jung il woo is Back? oooooh interesting oppppa your back fighting!!!! I hope the director in this drama is Kim Jung Min (The Princess Man) and i hope Go Ara will accept the lead female and the lead male i hope is park shi hoo or lee jun ki or lee jong suk',\n",

       "  'comments': \"The best character in this drama was the role of Jin Se-Yun a.k.a Shin So-Young, she was stronger profiler, glad Se-Yun nailed it, she deserves a better recognation:) Why do they keep casting Jin Se yun omg the girl always ruin the show for me.. sorry, I mean Pianika:( what song played with violin of a child? sorry can't english language d^,^bv What is it ?????????????? most weird drama i've seen i love this tv series!!! This drama has an interesting plot... but so so draggy. I watched 5 episodes of this 2x cause it was so boring and I still skipped some parts. I am out!! I love this korean drama. Many intense and unpredictable scenarios. Can't wait to watch the next episode. The Item is unique and spellbinding (some might think literally!). If you are tired of Korean dramas that are so predictable you know how they will end by episode 1 then check this one out for a cool change of pace. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. All the actors are superb. Gave this series a chance and i’m already hooked!! Too many unanswered questions but i hope revealation will be out bit by bit so that the mystery still remains! I really like this series and recommend people to watch! Just finish ep 14 and now waiting for next week! i watch th drama because i fans of Ju Ji Hoon. the more i see the episode, the more i love it but also the more question i got. i know this is fantasy drama but i still hope there will be explanation: I wonder why the rating isn't good? I like this drama. It's so intense and full with mystery. Too many bad guys and people involved around the items. More importantly, WHO created these items? Are the villain boss and villain priest work together? I wonder if the villain boss installed an item to himself that connected to the polaroid? I`m seeing a hell of a lot of similarities between this an The Lost Room...a lot of them.. The plot is okay, but it seems to drove off from what it should be. I have a high expectation but ugh now its not that high anymore. First, Ju ji Hoon acting is great and the chemistry with Jin Se Yeon is ok too, but I cant feel the villain mode when he appeared. I skipped the parts when the villain appeared bcs its too bored for me tbh. Plot 4/10, and acting 7/10. For cinematographic I would give 5/10. I am loving it already!!!! Very interesting plot Ju Ji Hoon and Kim Kang woo are such a great actor to watch with.. ❤️ Really excited for the next episode. Such a great drama!! Only 2 eps and I’m already obsessed! I really hope it gets the attention & rating it deserves!! I’m getting the supernatural vibe but please don’t end up being too ridiculous or bad cgi later on?? I really hope this drama will continue to grow, besides Touch Your Heart (more to romcom) this has definitely made it into my list. Can’t wait for more First Episode is such an Explosive! Kyaaa, Oh Seung Hoon!! I always follow his drama after defendant. Glad he got more spot. He is promising and talented actor. Love you oppa! Hwaiting!! <3 <3 hi, does any one know whats the name of music in teaser2? Day- 1:) so very very happy this drama was airing tomorrow, Jin Se-Yun looks great here and even Ju Ji-Hoon and Kim Kang-Woo, these cast were so amazing, I believe they all shine in this drama, goodluck! to all cast and to Princess Se-Yun we! love and support you:) I hope Jin Se Hyun’s acting wont be as flat as her previous dramas. I will be watching this because of JiHoon oppa Omg i love how sound system in this drama work! Its like hollywood movies;)) Jin Seyun so pretty here <3 Owaaah, Shin Rin Ah new drama Omgh, Jihoon and Kangwoo together in one drama.

       "  'comments': 'Han ji min and nam Jo hyuk . The age Gap so far 12 years. But they didn\\'t look like as their age Gap. They look as the same age. I wonder how can she manage her skin. Since I am in 26 years looks so old. It so hard to maintain the wrinkle on the face. Can someone plz ex[lain the ending of episode 10 please? I saw so many people disliking this awesome drama because they hate seeing an old protagonist, people just want Hye Ja to be young again for a cute love story. I started this drama thinking that it is indeed a cute romantic comedy but it is much more, it made me laugh, cry and question many things. Even though the drama isn\\'t finished yet, It is one of the best k-dramas I have seen. You should definitely watch it. What actually happened in the end of ep 10? Can somebody explain! What actually happened in the end of ep 10? Can somebody explain! This show is my favorite from 2019 kdramas so far.The story takes you the most unexpected places and events.It\\'s fun,tragic,comic and sad.So many mixed feelings.Well written,well shoten and acting is amazing.I started watching the show bc I love Kim Hye Ja so much,Han Ji Min as well but have no idea how the story and characters will evolve.Thankfully I\\'m not dissappointed at all.Son Ho Jun comedic acting is really something. the ending is already unpredictable..now the plot twist in ep 10.. come on?? When I watched Hye-Ja\\'s gotten older, I thought, the resolution of this drama must be Joon-Ha\\'s gotten older too. They would grow old together and not turn back to the younger selves. I had been suspicious at the wheelchaired-grandfather since the very beginning that he was older Joon-Ha, but refuted immediately after thinking \"how could older and younger Joon-Has be together in the same timeline\". such . a . good . drama! at first i thought it is just a time travel drama,never knew that i\\'d constantly crying at every episodes lol there is always such a scene that made me cry. just finished watching ep 10 and my oh my what a mind blowing episode. NJH act really gets better,every cast in this drama is great. Now i just have to patiently waiting for the next episodes,cant wait! I\\'m so confused I just watched episode 10 what is happening?? i\\'m really shock for the plot twist in eps 10, it\\'s a deeper and more sad but i hate it OMG the plot twist got me so shocked!!!! this drama definitely not a normal time travel drama!!! im so happy i spent 10hrs for this drama bcs it is really worth it gosh no one see it coming you know. the plot twist in ep10 changed my whole thought about this drama. 10/10 recommended!! Drama so amazing.. after i watched episode 10 i feel drama so so so amazing.. actually ending scene episode 10, the scene make me shock and confused.. can\\'t wait to see next episode next week. I hope in 2 last episode can see han ji min and nam joo hyuk because i need more their scene. I really don\\'t understand what they want to tell in episode 12.. at the first, it fun to watch but then in the last minutes it changed.. Plot twist in eps 10...that\\'s so mind blowing. Can\\'t wait for episode 11 and 12.. Episode 10 woww is the best episode!!!! This is good drama. Even I am getting boring in the middle of episode. But I love the twist. Worth to watch. Seriously! Episode 10 is OMG!! its so hilarious when the oldies doing rescue operation for Lee joon-ha and at the end is so unexpected. Its so deep that I need to watch the end again. Nice tiwist.. Can\\'t wait ep 11&12. Ep 10 left me confuse and get headache like HJ? oh my god... ep 10 is SO DEEP. definitely my favorite epsiode in the whole drama so far. so amazing, the ending of ep 10 is soo unexpected. sooo out of the box! written too well! definitely recommend this drama!!! OMG! I\\'m shocked by this drama! I don\\'t know how to express ... the way they unfolded the theme (...?). Episode 10 is expetacular! congratulations Episode 9 is simply amazing! I\\'m excited! Nam Joo Hyuk\\'s excellent performance made me cry! He cried beautiful and captivating! The performance of the protagonists and secondary is very good. If Hye Ja didn\\'t run and ride the back and just turned the clock a little earlier than that day or even the night before, it won\\'t happen. Hehehehehe I wanna know how and why is that watch so magical like that and how that haraboji turns into his younger self then to his older self. It\\'s still now making sense now but I believe they would show it. Really curious if Hye Ja would still transform into the 25 year old one. Will she? It become more boring. I love dramas that do not just dwell on the love story part. I love how this drama portrays life in general even if it has a fantasy twist to it. I like Nam Joo Hyuk here better than when he was in Weightlifting fairy Kim Bok Joo and Kim Hye Ja as a 25 year-old who one day became a 60-year old lady is too adorable to watch. I keep waiting for this to get better and I’m having a hard time sticking with it. This is just me or i dont really understand the main point of this drama:( when will hyeja back to her 25th? I miss hyeja & joon ha moment:( Why this serial focusing on the elderly too much? It makes the story boring even this serial is only in 12 episodes. I watch till 8 episodes that made me bored and difficult to be understood and the gist of the writer\\'s purpose is complicated. The moral value can\\'t be digested. I don\\'t understand people watching dramas of an actor that they hated most. @ punkie.... Be happy dear... Life is too short watching an actor that annoys you. Dramas are for us to get entertained, not to be stressed out Their couple moments were so cute and well done, I thought there\\'d be cute hijicks when she turns into grandma but instead it gets real about dreams and poverty etc. This dramas writing is definitely a bit weird when the 25 actually acts and thinks and speaks like a grandma when she\\'s supposed to be 25, and the whole reason she became old was so dumb, like can\\'t she have just thrown a rock at the car to make him stop instead of wasting 72766768 days trying to learn to ride a bike. What a dumbass. I hope this drama doesn\\'t keep getting sadder and she turns back soon because um I don\\'t think I have the heart to watch these sweet characters go thru this Non a fan Han Ji-Min. I keep trying... but she\\'s always plays annoying characters in all her drama. I only watch because of all the male leads in her drama. Glad this drama is cut short. Sorry, 25 yrs olds do not whine like that. Grannies do not whine like that. I don\\'t understand how people think this is a good drama. I understand the storyline, and the meaning behind the story-- the cost of wanting something, but still just act sad not whinny. so so good! i\\'ve been on a kdrama funk for a while and couldnt find anything that kept my interest. i highly recommend to anyone that values a storyline with depth. the leads have amazing chemistry and every side character storyline is entertaining. for those who like movie like dramas (ex: prison playbook, sky castle, etc.) do yourself a favor and watch this. you will NOT regret it Love Son hojun\\'s quirkiness <3 What a great story it turns out to be.... this is not just a mere time travel story....this is a story that values time, love, relationships....beautiful. Kim Hye Ja is awesome & splendid. I love her expressions of pain & sadness, & at times wonderment of simple things that she used to take for granted when she was the younger han ji min. How a change in age & face changed a whole lot of things in life. A story of sadness but full of beautiful & at times funny moments. This is a cable drama so above 3% rating is high. I hope this movie will end with happy ending even the movie plays in sad and problems occured in this movie. I hope Kim Hye Ja back to be young again and get her love with Lee Joon Ha. why just 12 eps? I hope this drama will get high rating so they will add more episodes:\"( nam joo hyuk\\'s acting is really improving and the story is funny and sad at the same time Nan Joo Hyuk is incredible in this drama. There is a very strong contrast between this character and your character from Weightlifting fairy kim bok joo ... I\\'m loving seeing this obscure, frustrated side of your new character. Congratulations?? Make the brother the main storyline it so much better Son ho-jun is so funny in this drama, cant stop laughing with his live broadcast... I think Nam Joo Hyuk finally find a character that suit him well... His acting is quite natural here in this drama. highly recommended drama. it\\'s funny and deep at the same time. you will laugh and learn how to taking care old people, how to treat them well and the most important is how to prepare to be them. so refresh and all actors is really good in acting. thank you for the writers and director. This drama will have you laughing and crying repeatedly. I highly recommend you watch this! this drama is soooo funny This Drama is Superb, Loving Nam Joo Hyuk\\'s great acting and Son Ho-Jun\\'s really funny. The girl is also good, but Nam Joo Hyuk carries this drama. Her old self is also good. I love the way Nam Joo Hyuk looking at her (ep 1) Since the main lead (Kim Hyeja) is around my age 25y/o i can relate almost everything that Kim Hyeja and Joonha been through right now. At the age of 25, you are done with your university life and now you\\'ll went to a phase of job hunting. But, you didn\\'t have a courage or confident to applied for the job. Seeing other people getting job you feel insecure and stress out. Still, i\\'m still questioning myself if i can ever land a job in my field of study. Rejection and ignored application is really painful. Due to those pain i\\'ve stopped trying for months. I wish someday I can get those missing pieces of confidence I lost. the story line, directing, acting really really good the best drama i watched in 2019. i just watched the current episode and about to cry when i had to wait for the next episode since i already addicted with this thing omg. you guys really need to watch this drama tho! This is the way I love to see Nam Joo-Hyuk! I\\'m hooked on this drama! OH and the brother. What a character! i totally in love with this drama. couldnt say more, you should watch it yourself and join me \"the suffering of waiting next episode\" So far this is the best drama I\\'ve seen in the past three years, I\\'ve seen at least around 70+ dramas (I know, I had no life lol) and this is the best so far! Noooo, 12 episodes again? haiz Just watch ep 1, its hillarious and sad at the same time. Run for ur dreams its so hard and yet u just can\\'t make urself stop from it.... Nam Joo Hyuk seeing you again on drama its so great i really miss you.. Han Ji Min after familiar wife here you are again happy to watching you, your so a great and amazing actress, and lastly Son Ho Jun oppa after go back couple I saw again your lovely face and your so good in acting I love you guyssss.. And the story is very interesting I surely watch it I must admit that I became interested in this drama because of Son Ho Jun, but having watched trailers and read different versions of its synopsis, I have to come to anticipate the drama for the story and timely lessons it hopes to deliver. I am excited for this drama. The plot looks interesting it is not the typical story you see in most K-dramas and the trailer ohmyyy God. The trailer looks heartwarming like something can make you cry and inspired at the same time. I am thinking this is an inspiring drama and something that will make you cry in some scenes. I have always loved Han Ji Min since watching her in Rooftop Prince and many may not like her in Hyde, Jekyll and Me but I love her in that Drama. Not to forget is the very handsome hunk Nam Joo Hyuk with his six pack abs. I love his character in Weightlifting fairy. I am hoping that this two leads have great chemistry together and this drama will be a big hit. Wah! This one have Han ji min, and also Son ho jun! looking good! ugh yes!! can\\'t wait!! I root for all cast here <3 i think she is Hwang Jung‑eum?? Han Ji Min!!! Son ho joon oppa?.. Can\\'t wait for it Hype for han ji min<3 Daebak! Sounds interesting! Can\\'t wait.. Finally Nam Joo Hyuk oppa is Back? This sounds interesting. Will watch when it is released!!!',\n",

       "  'comments': \"I thought I was watching Japanese manga series...Kamen Teacher now Kamen Preacher. following the Fiery Priest drama is not strong, it feels like following the Burning Sun drama, how the Pastor himself works to restore the good name of Father Lee who has been considered his own father, and many other justice needs to be questioned in drama, not to mention mouth problems knetz and if comments don't use brain after pressing it:'( I love it , Kim nam gil you are always one of the bestttttt , so hot , so cool , so funny , so sexy , so sweeeeett . Acting is great , mimics are wonderfull , the other caracters are so great and funny . Topic as typical but the functioning is great and very very very funny . Soooo amazing <3 Honestly I don't really care about the story, most of kdramas are dragging and filled with ridiculous coincidences anyway, however i still following this one bcs it's quite funny, like those slo-mo scenes in particular.. tl; dr it's another cliche good guys vs bad guys plot with some action in it. Only characters who are relevant are the priest and the female detective. Everyone else adds no value to the drama. Okay. I've now finished watching episode 10. Still slow but the good news is it's better. In short, I'd give it a chance if you're not already doing so. Hopefully, things pick up since it's a 40 episode drama. Slow. Draggy. Other than the male lead, all other characters are annoying. If you really want to watch, I recommend you just wait until the whole thing is out and skim through it. So much filler story. No likeable chemistry. This is only based on the first 4 episodes. I see potential and so I hope it gets better. Whenever Kim Nam Gil is (Drama or movie) , i pretty admire him.... He's an actor that can act precisely in all character he became.... he sooo hot in this drama... I only waiting this drama,all in, I found my self injoying watching KimNamGil so funny,love it Oh oops, it's only 20 ep. But I'll give it a try..maybe it will pick up later ep. I agree with sf. Looks like this kdrama trying so hard to be funny..but turns out to be annoying and dragging. 40 ep?? I don't know..? kim nam gil in this drama is superhot!! but i dont find any great chemistry between him and the female lead.....!! and am i the only one who find the female lead voice is very distracting and annoying? i rather ship the priest with the women detective. anyway, i will always support any kim nam gil drama..... oppa fighting!! When I first saw him in Legend of Orpheus I never thought that he would be a funny person till I watched Live Up to Your Name..This guy really has good sense of humour acting. Superb acting kim nam gil The male detective and the female prosecutor are totally useless for this drama. I only enjoy when I see the priest and the young female detective acting together. Great series,,,well done.... Wow...the Pope and the President of South Korea has cameos Can't deny the acting is great but the script writing was amazing...filled with drama, action, comedy and all in today's context. One of the greatest drama ever watched!!highly recommended!!great acting skills from kim nam gil!!!l❤ Michael will slay the dragons wow.. the rating is pretty good Honey lee is so beautiful and amazing as per usual. I'm already loving the chemistry between all the leads. Unnie fighting!!!!! kim nam gil is super cool!!!!!!love it.. he is so handsome? and perfect for this role\\ufeff I hope you win the best actor or grand prize kim kam gil-ssi KIM NAMGIL WILL SAVE 1ST HALF OF 2019!!! I love this drama already! I love Kim Nam Gil in Live up to Your Name and his act in this drama is superb too. All the cast are great. I guee Kim Sung Kyun and Lee Ha nee character will turn around in future episode. For the one who was curious about the familiar background music when Seo Sung-A laid a roundhouse kick to the Kkangpae:v in episode 2 As expected, Kim Nam Gil perfect for the character.... 1st episode and already lovin' it! The cast is too good. Nam Gil?❤️ Lee Ha Nee, Kim Sung Kyun, Kim Won Hae etc. The plot seems fine to me. I'm really hopeful for this drama. Im just only waiting this drama, others are ordinary remake and cheesy kim nam gil..playing drama again..\\ufeff love Kim Namgil doing comedy,can’t wait to this\\ufeff I think this is going to be one hella funny drama definitely will watch it for kim nam gil & go joon.. Why so many catholics priest this earlier, the guest, priest, priest again (?) I am stoked for another F-S timeslot for dramas! Fridays became kinda empty and my back flow of shows were caught up on then, but bring it on! Lee Honey, too, in a role so different from her usual sophisticated/elegant/seductive sexy lady! Has there been some insurgence of Catholics in SK lately? Sook many Catholics and nary a Protestant and only Buddhists in historic dramas and/or death ceremonies lately! Children of a lesser god vibes!!!???? A priest character again?! ohhh nooooo!!!!! cant waitttt.... love soo much kim nam gil acting in drama!!!! my favourite actor.... another The Guest?:D Lee Myung-Woo! Looking forward:) I love his acting on Live up of your name, shark and bad guy, he has a charming, hot guy and great actor... he's so cute with his expression,He has such huge eyes O.O His smile makes me meltss ...cant wait.... OMG does anyone remember that they were both in Shark?? It was the drama I first noticed Lee Honey. She was so adorable with her dimples in it. The plot sounds quite the same as The Guest. But let's see what will be the difference. My God, this has bring so much happiness! Yayayayayay Kim Nam Gil is back in drama! Was looking forward to see him in a challenging role. He loves his fans and so do we love him ❤❤❤❤❤❤ Hope this drama air soon with having little bit of romance between Kim Nam Gil and Lee Honey! It is a long time not seeing Lee honey- my prettiest Korean actress. Due to Lee honey’s charm it will be great I think. I cant wait to see her jusr accept this offer.. love to see him again.. kim nam gil fighting. this is greatttt!!!! kim nam gil is back in korean drama... love soo much... please take this drama... you are great and amazing actor... OMGGGG Kim Nam Gil-sshiiii!!! I truly hope he would receive this offer and make another triumph return to the small screen after last year's much appreciated Live Up to Your Name drama. It'll be crazily exciting to see him in an investigative drama + playing a cold character again. The writer is the same person who's responsible for the amazing Good Manager/Chief Kim so i'm sure it won't a bit dissapointed me. Since the leading actress hasn't been secured yet i'd like to voice my own suggestion on it lol. I'd like to see Kim Nam Gil to star alongside Jin Kin Joo, the actress who starred as the female lead in Come Here and Hug Me. She might be a rookue actress but she sure has great potential to becoming a great actress. Eugene or Hang Jeung Eum are great too since we all know they're some of the best seasoned korean actresses among their peers yay love this oppa deserving of a name\",\n",

       "  'comments': 'Park Han-Byul, don\\'t worry we will support you until the end. @lou me too ican\\'t find ost this dramaa:\"(( why did she reveal her real name yoon ma-ri? and joo hae-ra already knows ma-ri’s real idendity... Hello everyone, its better than let me introduce her, As i continue to watch it gives me an intense feeling that urge me to watch it more. Hands up to Park Ha Na and Ryu Soo Young superb acting. I hope Park Ha Na will continue to portray the role of Yoon Ma Ri. Park hana played the main role as Yoon mari! This role was very hard and she did it very well! Even I, who first wanted to watch this drama because of Park Han Byul, after watching park hana\\'s acting, I wished this role could continue with her acting, and yet you didn\\'t even name her as the main cast! It\\'s remake of a Japanese drama \\'Beautiful Person\\' not a copy of let me introduce her Love this drama no kdrama cliche of memory loss. Totally different feel to let me introduce her. Love the acting here cried a couple times already, but can feel the strong chemistry between the leads This drama is too much like Let Me Introduce Her. Sounds like a complete copy with some differences. This drama is too similar to \"let me introduce her\" I don\\'t care if its a remake. Its like some people say potato while others say \\'potato\\' its spelled the same way, and the dish served is the same therefore its the same thing I think both of male main actor is crazy lover to their love the drama is so beautiful, i cant anymore. i want now saturday again and again. I wish the scenario was without a subject like exchanging a face! if it was about a psychopath and charismatic husband who is obsessed with his wife, a good and attractive man and a beautiful and innocent woman and with a subject like violence against women, it was much more interesting and realistic! Anyway, after changing the face, if this psychopath husband still wants this girl, it\\'s very ridiculous, because he was only obsessed with that face, not with her and that face has already been destroyed! And can this doctor really fall in love with this woman, or will he need his ex-wife face with a better character?! And showing the scenes of physical conflict and husband\\'s violence and more charismatic and strong scenes about the husband\\'s passion, which suits the adult audience can make it more interesting! It\\'s good that this drama has the korean old melodrama vibes. It\\'s been so long and I missed it. One of those dark and depressive dramas, where the woman is sadistically abused during the first half, then chased by her abuser during the second half. I might as well cut my veins rather than watch, haha. watched first 4 episodes and I am hooked by this drama. This drama is really different and interesting from other typical romance dramas. a fresh concept. I am watching it mostly for Ji Hyun Woo. Loved him in Queen Inyun\\'s man. I hope this drama delivers. Start watching it guys. The plot looks very interesting! I hope this drama will be really entertaining and breathtaking! And it will be different from that drama people talk about, because I watched a little bit of let me introduce her and I didn\\'t like it! In addition, love in sadness has attractive cast and I like the female and male lead actors! Plot synopsis is very similar to Let Me Introduce Her i love him so much! ♥ all the dramas he\\'s in are so good , i really recommend watching it all. and now another drama.....cant wait to watch it! Ji Hyun Woo ♥ Great cast! Rooting for Ji Hyun Woo! He is acting as a father too! Let me introduce her part 2????? @yoshi I a gree with Your opinion.. Isn’t this basically Let Me Introduce Her? I don’t see he different in the summary... so, it\\'s a love triangle story? Ji Hyun-Woo, don\\'t he get bored with medical drama,cuz his recent drama also he act as a doctor \"Risky Romance\", why don\\'t try different role Little bit dissappointed to see RSY became an evil 2nd lead in this drama.. I love to see his gentle side like in good witch.. The plot seem similar to introduce her is it not? Or am I wrong g? Gonna definitely watch it though. is this going to be a medical drama? i hope it is! im\\'m rooting for Ji Hyun Woo oppa! i cantwait!',\n",

Cant wait for next eps. Ocn u the best OCN dramas are so incredibly good! Gonna watch it for sure omg... is it based on webtoon? daebak. i hope it will be great as trilogy or more than 3 series of possessed series. Is this story going to be funny or what....the teaser is all funny there...haha... Koh joon hee can be beauty queen seriously there are not so pretty actesses as far as her. Thus she is underrated I think. But after this drama her popularity might be increase. My fav actresses Lee young ae, lee ha-nui, shin min ah, kim hyun-joo, song hye kyo, park so dam, kim go-eun have unique facial expressions that make me emotional. SPEC korean version?? I'm so happy! It's about time Koh Joon Hee got better roles. Really can't wait. I'm so happy! Looks like Koh Joon Hee got a good role after quite some time. Really can't wait. can't wait!\",\n",

       "  'comments': '@ Queen Is kim kwon a villain in this drama? I want to know who are the smart guys on episode 2 I am loving this drama! The chemistry is just perfect. I can\\'t wait for the next episode!! The first 2 episodes are quite enjoyable. Can\\'t wait for the next 2. LeeAn and Jinyoung , wuah their character very different and that makes me love him more?? please look forward the next episode guyss???? I was impressed with the leads\\' acting! Wow! Keep it up Park Jinyoung & Shin Yee Eun!??? Really loving this drama so far. Not only is this my favourite genre but the actors/actresses portray the emotions so well. Yi ahns character especially. He makes me laugh and cry and laugh and cry. Well done Jinyoung for your amazing actors. Also the chemistry between the 4 leads is so nice. I honestly love seeing their scenes together. And the story development is quick which i love. (I dont like dramas which drag?). Everything from the cast to the acting to the story line and the visuals is just right for me. Please show this drama support. Its really good especially if you like suspense dramas. I honestly cant wait to see how this mystery unfolds. But i have a feeling im gonna be crying a lot.? Anyways 11/10 for this drama. And its only been 2 episodes. Oh and i love the chemistry between jinyoung and ye eun too. They both just look so good together?? I\\'m so excited, I love it. I love the characters, I love Lee An\\'s acted. Look how He acted cute and sexy, gosh I can\\'t handle it ♥ I\\'m so excited, I\\'m so proud of my man Jinyoungie~~ Amazing. This drama made me laughed, cried, angry. So excited, uri Jinyoungie~ show us how to acted cute, sexy, and poor. Every time I watched it I wanna give him a hug, I\\'m so proud. From junior to jinyoung ♡ This is Jinyoung\\'s first lead role in a drama and I can\\'t be more excited. I watched the first two episodes and the plot looks really interesting... the perfect mix between thriller, comedy and supernatural drama. The characters Jinyoung and Yeeun play are really lovable and they look like they\\'re going to be multidimensional. The four main actors have also great chemistry, which I love too! Can\\'t wait for the next episodes! ^^ I was a little skeptical at first about the storyline but l was really impressed on the first episode and Lee an is a funny character and complex Great chemistry for all of the main leads, interesting story, and i like that the development is fast. Its so fun to watch! The script also so far good. I laughed, cried, and thrilled since the first episode. Can’t wait for the the next ep!! I sure that culprit is kang sung mo 2019 is not a good vintage for K-dramas. We are already March, soon April, and nothing exciting to watch on the horizon. This drama is so exciting. i hope Korea will appreciate it! Fighting JinYoungie and Team He Is Psychometric!??? Just the idea of being able to see out jinyoungnie for 16hours is???? Isn\\'t this based on the manga \"Psychometrer Eiji\"? The story is exactly the same. \"Unlike his handsome appearance, he is not smart at all\" How does being attractive correlate with intelligence?? Koreans LOL. Yes because Einstein was a hottie. So excited! watching it for Shin Ye Eun!!?? So excited >-< Jinyoung is going to be AMAZING! Its my boy\\'s first role as the lead.I wish him nothing but a successful comeback .Lets pray the general public love the storyline.For now it looks really intriguing.Cant wait for march 11th. I was a psychology student, and the title makes me feel \"what?! Do every people think psychometry is a will to read people mind? Or what?!\"?? anyway, I am looking forward for this drama Why does this almost sound like the drama \" The Lucifer\"? I know it is a remake of a Taiwanese movie.. I think, but the way they wrote it, it just seems like the same. I will watch give it a try though. I\\'m sure the storyline is completely different, and I like stuff like this. Actor of the year <3 Jinyoung . Unlike his handsome appearance, he is not smart at all <--- LOL. Let Me Laugh First  teasers are up? I can the most savage guy from idol band always make into acting/ to be an actor. Name it, GOT7 Jinyoung and EXO D.O. So when will BTS make Suga into acting too?? Lol no hate guys xDD Just excited looking these savage trios to have similarities in acting I suppose xD But I know obviously Yoongi is a lazy man, he wont make it happen. Finally Jinyoung first male lead on TV drama. He is an excellent actor wait till you all being swayed 1st drama of shin ye eun cant wait longer 1st drama of shin ye eun cant wait Jinyoungiiieee.. finally!! can’t wait.. he is very good actor and thx God he got his 1st lead roll, fighting uri actor Park ^^ Choi moon sik (kim kwon) and jinyoung, woohoo seems interesting Jinyoung did Great on The Legend of the Blue Sea.

Fighting for Jinyoung and all the drama crew and other casts Can\\'t wait to see our jinyoungie on screen ❤❤?? I already know this drama is going to be great! Jinyoungie hearing?!

Park Eun Seok Oppa...:)) I like act at Investigation Couple:)) O wow, Choi Won-Young and Kim Byung-Chul from “Skycastke” will reunite in this drama, great actors! Goong Min Oppa... fighting!!! ^_^ I thought this was the manga that got a TV-show with the same name Really love Nam Goong Min from Chief Kim. His acting is so brilliant. When I read the plot, this movies really reminds me of Cross last year. I think Cross is a good drama but the rating was quite low. Hope that Nam Goong Min will do better. I have no idea about the female lead because I have not watched any drama of her before, but she is good-looking, hope she will also do well I hope this much better than Cross sorry I do love medical genre but I feel disappointed on Cross, I trust you KBS give us comedy type with intense pure medical scenes *O* writernim, This time please do it comedy not sad drama such as Cain and abel or foolish mom. I really suspected after looking through of your previous works. tough guy role doesn't suit uri cracked actor Nam goong And as expected, Min Nam Goong is caught in another interesting series. Fell in love with his acting after Chief Kim ♡ Hopefully Nara accepts the offer.. I miss seeing her in a drama T T I'm waiting!!! funny phsyco dr. Na... Ah Nam goong min ssi! I missed him so much. Since romantic dramas are not really my genre, so the last time i watched his drama is falsify. Gonna looking forward to this! I love medical drama! make him like from,psychopacth,chief kim,chef, lawyer, hotel manager,now doctor... OMG!!! Namgoon min as a doctor? It will be the best drama of 2019. Wow Namgum min back with another drama.\",\n",

       "  'comments': 'Whoa, he is almost unrecognizable in the poster (in a good way)! My first thought was \"huh, that looks like the Chief Kim cute nemesis guy\" then I realized oh, right, that IS the same guy! Their eyes are different, but this look has a Jin Goo sort of vibe with a little Park Seo Joon (Secretary Kim edition) thrown in. Yoo Jae Myung never disappoints, either-is is such a phenomenal veteran actor and can pull off everything from a homeless man drunk around the clock to a scruffy overly serious surgeon or sharp nasty businessman and then turn around and make your eyes watery playing what I assume is most like him, a sweet tender family man. This will be awesome as long as this writer\\'s script holds together on its own-and tvN is the BEST at finding new talent both in actors and writers, hands down (hence the made in tvN meme)! Junho looks so serious and manly in this drama. This haircut compliments his face perfecly. He looks so hot. When i see him standing so handsome on the poster and acting so cool in the trailer i think he is going to win yet an other award. Go Junho! Love crime drama. This is exciting. Nice! shin hyun bin from MISTRESS & of course our Joon Ho Cannot wait for this. I\\'ve been a HUGE fan of Junho since Chief Kim. Anticipating this very much. Yes! I can’t wait, a new project for Junho:) And it’s about law, the most interesting topic The leading lady is an awesome actress. Solid pairing. Wow! Jun ho\\'s new drama:D looking forward to this. Waiting for another Junho\\'s character:) OMG.. I hope the female lead will be a good actress, we don\\'t want anybody pulling this drama back. Ohh what a treat! Who is the lucky leading lady? Whoever it is please be good as our Junho has had amazing co leads. Can’t wait for his film with Jung So Min. Yesterday i was thinking about his acting and i was telling myself why he didn\\'t comeback with a new drama and i just checked the site and i found him take a main role in a new drama yas. Looking forward for the drama. Keep it up our junho i\\'m really excited, what a interesting plot. junho ily',\n",

I\\'m so happy, Park Bo Young is my favourite actress and I\\'ve loved Ahn Hyo Seop since the first time I saw him in Entertainer back in 2016. This is going to be amazing. Interesting plot. So excited to this drama. Fighting Park Bo Young ssi! I really really wish it was lee min ho. Theyre so cute together. Boyoung like lee but lee just not into her. But he will fell for her dahhh our boyoung is so lovable.. We just need some push... love the pair. looking forward for the drama. another super tall actor again, Boyoung-agashi! (and a younger! *damn*) i hope your neck will be treated well hehe. Hyoseop-ah, do your best and wish your acting skills will advance since you\\'re playing drama with our beloved Boyoung. I somekind of agree with others that Hyun Hyun Bin should be cast opposite her or Yang Se Jong Or Park Hyung Sik!! But now Ahn Hyo Seop is finalised and I hope he do the justice to his character! Waiting for this drama to air Welcome Back Park Bo young ssi ❤ this is kind of first male lead for Ahn hyo seop and that to opposite with Park Bo Young.. I hope he do the justice with this role and has to remain firm in front of Park Bo Young!! All the best Ahn Hyo Seop ssi!! Am i only the one who think take a younger actor as lead?

       "  'comments': 'hmmmmm.. i smell sad ending already:( Im so excited to this drama?? Looking forward for this drama Director of Healer and Queen of Seven Day It interests me and Shin Hye Sun is an excellent actress. Hye Sun and dong hum here excellent but L i a bit confused Excited for this! I love both L & Hye Sun! people just have to accept that idols can be multi talented... Nice. I hope L (I would prefer JunHo or Lee Joon) will be up to Shin Hye Sun, I liked his drama Miss.hummarabi, I find he was convaiting without being excellent, I must admit that a role of judge is quite difficult so I hope that it will be better as an angel. it looks cliche but i\\'m waiting for this it will be broadcast in May, the drama Vagabond is also broadcast in May, there will be competition. go shin hye sun i support you i hope this drama will have good raiting!! Fighting! Guys face is too pretty for his acting to be considered serious. I think L is completely underrated as an actor. He has been excellent in every part I have seen him in. The pattern is always the same -- L is cast, there are negative comments and disappointment, then glowing reviews of his acting when the drama ends. Most people are multi-talented. Just because you are a singer, does not mean you cannot act. I look forward to seeing L in this part. Not this girl no choose another young girls Shin Hye Sun My fav actress <3 Yass L! FIghting! Please hire a real actor for this drama!!!! Keep idols\"wanna be actors\" to a minimum!!!! Omg, shin hyesun and L!!! I like both of them, really look foward to this drama???? L, please acc this drama. I ship them together <3 An actor for the male lead please. I love Shin Hye Sun and I want to see her ext with a good actor and not an idol. the scriptwriter... no hope... why every trash scriptwriters got their chance again and again? even Park Bo Gum and Song Hye Kyo works for a trash scriptwriter. Soon Kim So Hyun will do the same too... This INFO is wrong... Can some9ne please tell L to accept this? OMG L with Shin Hye Sun? I know that SHS is a excellente actress but I a bit confused with L. I will wait for this show MYUNGSOO PLEASE DONT ACCEPT THE ROLE Hope kim bum will play as Dan.. Shin Hye Sun declined the offers ooooooohhhhhh interesting cant wait wow Jian-shi , oh, No Shin Hye Sun ı hope accept.. you are the best artist , deserve.. himneyoo^^',\n",

Everytime I hear about his upcoming shows, I get excited and can’t help but to be excited:) Im Ju Hwan, Fighting! O..M..G the greatest cast! Lee yo won & Nam gyu ri from 49day. So looking forward to watching this. I luv luv the casts, All of em & D plot too Nam Gyu Ri and Lee Yo Won finally reunited after 49 days. Hopefully this drama is a happy ending. Nearly Had Heart Attack....................... This is the bestest casting ever..................... OMG............. Lee yo won and Yoo ji tae...... omggggggggggggg Hopefully LYW can show her acting skills like her previous drama 49 days! I will watch this. Definetely. oooooo, one of my fav actress, really like her. Can't wait MBC!!!! MBC is back airing period dramas ❤❤❤❤ Kim Won-bong? A character that played by Cho Seung-woo in 2015's Assassination? Tbh, I am kinda upsaet Lee Yong Ae can not do this drama. But, omg! Its Lee Yoo Won! So, I am happy again. Both are great actress and I always feel that their are sister since They really look a like Well it shucks that lee young ae is not cast anymore. Well I heard that Yoo Ji Tae was offered a role. I don't know why but this PD seems to be very nostalgic towards Lee Young Ae past works. Could we get a noona-romance, if there is romance? I can see it happening after her chemistry with Yang Se Jong in Saimdang's Dairy. May the drama be very popular and get a lot of praise after broadcasting in the future. Ooohhh, the plot sounds so interesting!! Can I either have So JiSub or Cha SeungWon as the male lead? If there's romance, hopefully the male lead is Lee Sung Jae. This ahjusshi is hot and needs a male lead comeback. Or maybe, Han Suk Kyu? I am with You @Amy. I think Cha Seung woon will be a hood match for her.... They wil lbe a perfect comboii Wonbin or jo in sung If we get to suggest the male lead, I vote for Joo Jin Mo. Cast Won Bin as the male lead please though i'm not that sure he's even reviewing any drama offers? i'm so excited for your new drama Cha seung won for the male lead. I wanna see him. I think he's the right choice for this genre Wow....great news....lee young ae...will be waiting for you in this drama. Daebak So excited °•.•° (^_^) :) hyun bin or So Ji Sub for the male lead? DAEBAK.....Lee Young Ae never fails to amaze me..am sure this will also be a good project just like Saimdang..Hope for a good male lead.Hwaiting\",\n",

Hmm, I hope the story will be more interesting than before ¬_¬ I am a huge fan of SYJ and I wanted to see her again in small screen. Disappointed that it won't happen very soon but I am glad she declined. I wanted to see her paired with another actor like Park BoGum, Park Seo Jun, Choi Jin Hyuk or anyone, younger than her or not or maybe Hyun Bin or Kim So Hyun if he's out of military. She can portray any role and I know she'll excel... I hope she'll have a better drama projects this year. Han ji min!!! yes i love her acting:D YES! Han Jimin and Jung Haein are both amazing!

I wasn\\'t too fond of While You Were Sleeping, and I don\\'t usually watch Lee Seung Gi (he\\'s back on the scene though pumping out dramas like a machine), but I will because of Suzy. And good really because I\\'d like to see his talent. The plot also seems promising. Something interesting. This must be Gu Family Book season 2, I mean as Present Day not Joseon drama version lol! is it true that this kdrama will be produced in Morocco? if so I am the most excited human being ever ㅋㅋ Wow! Lee Seung Gi is so busy after he was released from his mandatory military training! First, \"Hwayugi - A Korean Odyssey\", now \"Vagabond\"! Very nice! My top list Kdrama fave is GFB! Really excited with this drama! ^_^ Suzy no please:| @Nayu You know you\\'re too late right? lol Lee seung gi - famous actor Suzy wth seo kang joon plissss??? Hahahaha laugh how production can give offer to Suzy?? She much have controversy this year .. New break with Lee Dong Wook . Suzy maybe after this you try Lee Seung Gi!! Good Luck new L E E This is definitely the season 2 of Gu Family Book.So excited.... HAHAHAHAHA! Kang Chi, Yeo wol and Gon are back together! this is Gu Family Book season 2 here my friends. okay honestly I hate suzy\\'s acting and I hate the fact that she pairs up with the top actors regardless of her acting skills it makes me not want to watch the actors drama I already haven\\'t watched like 3 of them cause she was in it. Like I loved her in Dream High don\\'t get me wrong but that was it. I\\'m just sour that she gets tagged in with the actors that recently did extremely well and know that the audience is anticipating their dramas. like wtf man... ...(Lee Seung-Gi) is a stunt man who dreams of becoming a world famous action actor.... They are together againnn.I can\\'t wait to see this drama!!!! I can\\'t wait for Lee seung gi.. Such an amzing and talented actor. From king 2 hearts to hwayugi. His growth as an actor was superbbbb! So excited for this! Lee seung gi\\'s acting is excellent. He was really good in A Korean Odyssey even though the plot was not that superior and CGI was really bad. Lee seung gi is top A actor @Kdramaaddict. there are some actors who played as couples more than once in different dramas. Choi Ji Woo - Kwon Sang Woo, Jang Hyuk - Jang Na Ra, Kim Soo Hyun - Jun Ji Hyun (the first time they were paired up with was in a movie tho), Eric Moon - Jung Yu Mi, Lee Dong wook - Lee Da Hae are some of the on-screen couples who have been paired up more than once. Lee Seung Gi & Suzy chemistry was no joke in GFB i really loved how they stare each other. GFB rating was also really daebak! The end made me make wishes for years that it will make season 2 and My wish has been granted to have GFB s2 although it\\'s different drama but I really happy right now oma gaaahhh! VAGABOND i hope you guys can go daebak! Lee Seung Gi Suzy fighting!!! I\\'ve always wait for Lee Seung-Gi dramas omg, the release date not even mentioned yet. i hope suzy\\'s character is really badass a strong independent woman who doesn\\'t need a guy to always save her im tired of that kind of characters we need more women empowerment in kdramas Is this official? I\\'ve never seen couple being repeated. Again. They have good chemistry. In gu family book. I have been waiting for this news so desperately. Bae Suzy and Lee Seung GI were great together in GFB. This reunion makes me super happy and excited. I can\\'t wait to see you in beautiful suits, Suzy. I love you both. finally this couple come back i like them.... Please suzy, don\\'t die in the end haha SO so so so so happy about this news, will wait patiently for next year, its going to be great guys Suzy Fighting!!! This one will surely be great. Cant wait gu family book season 2, kekekekeke. Love you two Suzy & Seunggi I miss gu family book. Wow, Suzy received so many roles in drama this year! Song hye kyo please Ha Ji Won and Lee Seung Gi please.. Super miss them together.. Although there are a lot of new kdramas, i prefer watching TK2H again and again.? super love them both:??? Ha Ji Won please!! Ha Ji Won! Ha Ji Won! Hope this is trueee, so happy if it is!!!??? Hope Seung gi will accept this, but if this is action.. I prefer Ha Ji-won to be his partner:) miss their tandem! Suzy and Lee seung gi i hope Seung Gi oppa will accept it..?? Kim Ji won and Lee Seung Gi Please!!!! Kim Seul Ki please;) Will suzy pick lee seung gi or park bo gum?? suzy has been getting a lot of offers right now wow okay but then in her interview she said that she is taking a break from acting for her music career. Ugh. Oh Yeon Seo please! Ha Ji Won please I hope Lee Seung Gi will accept the role, so he can showcase another part of him being an actor. And most importantly, he will be appearing again on my screen twice a week for the drama. But what to do, he has Master in the House and the upcoming Produce 48. And he keeps going out Korea for his fan meeting. This sexy namja is a busy bee. Cast Han hyo joo please Yehey! I hope Lee Seung Gi and Oh Yeon Seo will be the leads but as long as it is Lee Seung Gi I will definitely gonna watch it.. So Excited! Please ~ please cast LEE SEUNG GI & OH YEON SEO! I LOVE them both act together. Thank you Please please cast Lee Seung gi and oh Yeon Seo! We need another successful reunion of these two actors again. Dear Celltrion Entertainment, please cast Oh Yeon Seo and Lee Seung Gi again. Hwayugi ending was such a disappoinment. Jun ji hyun song joong gi Please cast LEE SEUNG GI & OH YEON SEO again. Hopefully the female lead is Yoon Eun-Hye:) #SeunggiEunhye Jun ji hyun with song joong gi please Seunggi was amazing actor. I hope he will accept this drama. I hope seunggi will accept this drama. So, we\\'ll meet seunggi\\'s great acting again Park bo gum with suzy or han hyo joo Seung Gi got an offer before his discharge and they seem to still wait for him. I want to know more about the plot to say whether I want him in or nah. But the writers/PD team is a dream team. *-* Jun ji hyun and song joongi or suzy and park bo gum please',\n",

       "  'comments': \"I don't like their acting, they are both very beautiful, but not talented to be actors.. imo Always excited to see Shin Se Kyung! She is excellent in everything she does. She is more of a western style actor, so a lot of kdrama fans don't get it. Comedy, drama or sageuk, she is great! Omg shin sekyung and eunwoo I love them both i guess both of the leads are not really good with acting? but maybe it will turns out to be good idk His gf is the same age as Kang Mirae ok then. The female lead just ruined it for me... sorry eunwoo:( Cant wait to see cha eunwoo & shin sekyung!! Will definitely be watching this drama for Shin Se Kyung alone. She has showcased great acting in saeguk roles. Can't help but think that this drama is writter for or with her in the writer's mind. How refreshing to see an empowering role for women. Noona again...:( Can't wait, love both actors I really want Cha Eun Woo's character here to be something really different from the character in 'My ID Is Gangnam Beauty'. His character as Do Kyung Sook was pretty boring itself and it wasn't his fault why his acting had to be so stiff and expressionless. In 'The Best Hit' where Eun Woo played a supporting character, his acting was pretty good and the character he had there wasn't a boring or a silent character who doesn't speak much. I hope his character here is just like the one in 'The Best Hit'! I believe all the people who are against Eun Woo's acting would be surprised. so excited for eunwoo but the female actress owww not this one!sorry eunwoo i can’t take her acting...anyways 2 decade kdrama fan here Excited for your comeback project Shin Se Kyung!! Synopsis sounds interesting, will probably watch it no matter who is cast. aighhh, one less drama to choose from Lim Soo Jung would be good as female lead @Rae Lee as if Cha Eun Woo is any better lol If Cha Eun Woo does decide to take the role, I am sure he will do fine; however, I personally am not sure I like him being cast with such an older actress, yet again, at least not so soon. I think that would be the only reason to maybe turn down this role. The same thing kind of happened with Jung Hae In and I don't think that is going to turn out so well for him long term, as he seems to be in danger of being typecast. I hope not. In any case, I can't wait for Cha Eun Woo to be in another drama, I hope very soon. Go go go Shin Se Kyung!!! Miss you in dramaland and always up for your phenomenal saeguk performance. Can't wait for July!!! Waaah!!! so excited to see you again in hanbok. Cha Eunwoo? Oh please no. No hate, but he's just a pretty face. He was wooden af with just 1 expression in Gangnam Beauty. I hope if he is indeed in this he has improved since then.\",\n",
